"""Guard the /grind review gate, parking and retry rules in the bundled assets.

#1424: a reviewer never rejects because nothing has been run; it lists
`must_verify` for the integrator, and a rejected sequential goal is parked.
#1425: the integrator reads a failure before retrying and never loops a suite.
The end-to-end behavior is in `tests/harness/test_grind_review_gate.py`.
