"""Static guards for /grind prework (#1408) and problem reporting (#1411).

The harness tests (`tests/harness/test_grind_prework.py`,
`tests/harness/test_grind_problems.py`) drive the real Claude Code and are
opt-in. These read the bundled assets and sources directly, so the contract
they pin holds in every `bash test` run.
