"""`/grind`'s review gate, parking and retry rules on the real Claude Code.

#1424: the reviewer cannot run anything, so an unrun check is never a
rejection. It approves on reading and lists `must_verify`, which reaches the
integrator's prompt; a rejection that only says "nothing has been run" is
overridden. A rejected sequential goal's files are parked on a local
`wip/grind-<goal>` branch by an integrator `PARK goal` call, so the next goal
starts from a clean `origin/<main>`, and a goal that depends on a rejected
goal is blocked before any worker writes.

#1425: the integrator reads a deterministic failure instead of rerunning the
suite. A scripted model cannot decide, so the test pins what the integrator
is told, and that clud's hook refuses it a lint/test retry loop.

Script note (as in `test_grind.py`): a step's `expect` checks the tool
results of the *previous* step.
