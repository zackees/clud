# clud Design Decisions

ADR-style records for non-obvious design choices in clud. Each entry follows the structure: Context, Decision, Rationale, Alternatives Considered, Consequences.

Decisions are numbered for stable cross-references (e.g. `DD-005`). Numbers are append-only; superseded decisions stay in place with a "Superseded by" note.

## DD-001: Rust binary distributed as a Python wheel via maturin `bindings = "bin"`

**Context:** clud is a CLI that orchestrates other CLIs (`claude`, `codex`) on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Its distribution channel needs to reach Python developers (the primary audience already running `pip install` for AI tooling) without forcing them to install a Rust toolchain or hand-pick a binary for their platform.

**Decision:** Implement clud as pure Rust binaries in `crates/clud-bin`, then package and distribute them as a Python wheel using `maturin` with `[tool.maturin] bindings = "bin"`. Installing the wheel places the native `clud` executable and helper executables such as `clud-block-bad-cmd` onto the user's `PATH`. The Python package (`src/clud/__init__.py`) is a thin version shim with no runtime code.

**Rationale:**
- Single artifact per platform: `pip install clud` works the same on Windows, macOS, and Linux without users picking a binary.
- maturin's `bindings = "bin"` is the supported way to ship CLI binaries through PyPI; no custom wheel-building code needed.
- Rust gives us the runtime characteristics clud needs: predictable startup, no GC pauses on the PTY hot path, easy static binaries, and the `windows-rs`/`ConPTY`/COM ecosystem for Windows quirks (DD'd separately).
- PyPI also reaches the audience that runs `uv tool install` and `pipx install`, both of which extract the binary into a managed `PATH`.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Pure Python | Cannot meet startup latency goals; PTY/COM/IDropTarget work is painful or impossible in pure Python on Windows. |
| Standalone binary releases (GitHub releases only) | Users must download, chmod, and place on PATH manually. Loses the `pip install` workflow that this audience already uses. |
| Cargo install (`cargo install clud`) | Requires every user to have a working Rust toolchain. Painful on Windows. |
| Python C extension (`bindings = "pyo3"`) | Forces a Python runtime in the hot path. clud is a CLI, not a library — it doesn't need Python at all once it's on PATH. |

**Consequences:**
- The release pipeline has to build platform-specific wheels (6 platforms x 4 CI jobs = 24 jobs).
- Wheel updates trigger a hot-overwrite of `Scripts/clud.exe` on Windows, which is why `trampoline.rs` exists (rename-self-then-copy-back). See [windows-quirks.md](architecture/windows-quirks.md).
- A `clud` upgrade is `pip install -U clud` rather than a separate self-update mechanism.

---

## DD-002: YOLO mode is the default; `--safe` is the opt-out

**Context:** clud's primary value is reducing friction when running Claude Code and Codex in agent mode. The upstream agents prompt for permission on every tool call by default, which makes long-running automation impossible.

**Decision:** Unless the user explicitly passes `--safe`, clud injects the effective harness's non-interactive permission flag: `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for Claude or `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox` for Codex. This applies to every harness invocation (interactive, loop, daemon).

**Rationale:**
- Users reach for clud specifically to skip per-call prompting. Defaulting to "prompt for everything" would defeat the purpose.
- The opt-out (`--safe`) is one word, easy to remember, and preserves the safe path for users who want it.
- A single decision point in `command::build_launch_plan_for_target` means there is no path that forgets to apply the policy.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Off by default, opt-in `--yolo` | Most invocations would need `--yolo`, adding noise and creating muscle memory that defeats the safety value of the off-by-default. |
| Per-backend default (claude on, codex off) | Inconsistent UX; hard to explain. |
| Read from a config file | Adds a hidden global setting; behavior depends on machine state. |

**Consequences:**
- New users must be told about `--safe` (covered in `README.md`).
- Any production code path that bypasses `build_launch_plan_for_target` would silently lose YOLO injection; see [DD-005](#dd-005-single-launchplan-as-source-of-truth-for-everything-clud-runs).

---

## DD-003: All Rust toolchain calls go through `soldr`

**Context:** clud is developed on Windows where `cargo` and `rustc` are routinely shadowed by stale shims — chocolatey's bundled cargo, rustup proxies for the wrong toolchain, system `rustc` from package managers. Builds that work locally for one developer fail for another for path-shadowing reasons that are tedious to diagnose.

**Decision:** Every `cargo`, `rustc`, and `rustfmt` invocation in this repo (developer workflow, CI, scripts) must go through `soldr <tool>` (https://github.com/zackees/soldr). soldr resolves the rustup-managed toolchain via `rustup which` and invokes that binary directly, bypassing whatever shim is on `PATH`. A `.claude/hooks/check-soldr.py` PreToolUse hook blocks any bare `cargo`/`rustc`/`rustfmt` Bash command and tells the user to install soldr.

**Rationale:**
- Eliminates "works on my machine" caused by shim drift on Windows.
- Mechanical enforcement (the hook) means new contributors hit a clear error message instead of a mysterious build break.
- soldr is a standalone binary; no Python dep, no toolchain coupling.
- CI uses `zackees/setup-soldr@v0` so local and CI invocations are identical.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Document "use rustup-managed cargo" in CLAUDE.md | Tried this; relied on each contributor reading and remembering. Drift recurred. |
| `cargo +<toolchain>` invocations | Still relies on `cargo` itself resolving to the right binary first. |
| Pin the toolchain via `rust-toolchain.toml` only | Rust-toolchain.toml works for rustup-managed cargo but not for shadowed `cargo`. Necessary but not sufficient. |

**Consequences:**
- New contributors must install soldr before they can build (`./install` or `./install --global`).
- All shell snippets in docs, `bash build`, `bash test`, etc. use `soldr cargo …` everywhere.

## DD-004: Backend-agnostic — support both Claude and Codex

**Context:** Users run different upstream agents (`claude` and `codex`) with similar but not identical CLI surfaces. Each backend has its own arg conventions, model-flag placement, prompt-injection mechanism, and skill-install location.

**Decision:** clud detects which backends are on `PATH` and supports either via `--claude` / `--codex` flags. The `Backend` enum is plumbed through every code path that constructs argv and every persistent launch-setup action. Where backends diverge (`--model` placement, `-p` semantics, `stream-json` injection, the `exec`/`resume` keywords), the divergence is encoded inside `command/`. Skills bundled into the `clud` binary install to `~/.claude/skills/` for Claude Code and `~/.codex/skills/` for Codex (mirrored layout), only during global launch setup for the selected backend; stale clud-managed copies under the retired `~/.agents/skills/` path are purged best-effort during Codex global setup (see [DD-013](#dd-013-codex-skills-install-to-codexskills-mirror-of-claude)).

**Rationale:**
- Locks clud into supporting users on either backend without forking the binary.
- The single-`LaunchPlan` discipline ([DD-005](#dd-005-single-launchplan-as-source-of-truth-for-everything-clud-runs)) absorbs backend divergence in one place (`command/`), so downstream code never branches on backend.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Claude-only | Cuts off users who prefer Codex or are evaluating both. |
| Two separate binaries | Code duplication; bug fixes have to land twice. |
| Adapter layer that homogenizes the backends | Premature abstraction; backend diffs are small enough to encode directly. |

**Consequences:**
- `command/` carries `if backend == Backend::Claude { … } else { … }` branches; concentrated, easy to audit.
- The skill system needs to handle two install targets; the single installer that serves both is [DD-039](#dd-039-bundled-skills-have-exactly-one-source-of-truth).

---

## DD-005: Single `LaunchPlan` as source of truth for everything clud runs

**Context:** clud has many code paths that need to know "what argv will clud actually run with these flags?" — the runner itself, the daemon worker, `--dry-run` JSON output for tests, the loop iteration loop, hook health remediation, and so on. Each path independently reconstructing argv is a recipe for divergence (one path forgets YOLO injection, another places `--model` in the wrong slot).

**Decision:** Every production code path goes through `command::build_launch_plan_for_target` and consumes the resulting `LaunchPlan` struct (`crates/clud-bin/src/command/types.rs`). The older `command::build_launch_plan` function remains only as a native-harness compatibility wrapper for tests and callers that have not yet adopted resolved launch targets. The struct carries the executable argv (including prompt arguments), working directory, optional loop markers, optional repeat schedule, and resolved provider/harness metadata. The daemon serializes the complete plan; `--dry-run` emits a stable JSON projection of the same plan. The runner, daemon worker, and remediator each consume the plan.

**Rationale:**
- One implementation of "what runs" means no drift between dry-run output and actual execution.
- Tests that exercise plan construction (via `--dry-run`) automatically exercise the same path runtime uses.
- Adding a new code path that needs argv is mechanical: resolve a launch target, call `build_launch_plan_for_target`, and consume the struct.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Each path builds its own argv | Verified to cause drift; YOLO and `stream-json` injection bugs found in early iterations. |
| Function-based ("`build_argv(args) -> Vec<String>`") | Loses the structured fields (prompt, markers, schedule) and forces every consumer to re-parse strings. |

**Consequences:**
- Any new launch-affecting feature must extend `LaunchPlan` rather than wire data through side channels.
- The `--dry-run` JSON contract is load-bearing for tests; breaking changes need test updates.
- See [launch-plan.md](architecture/launch-plan.md) for the construction pipeline and consumer list.

## DD-006: `~/.clud/data.redb` is owned exclusively by a single GC daemon process; clients access it over loopback TCP

**Context:** clud needs persistent state for tracked entries (used by `clud gc list` / `purge` / `reconcile`) and the worktree scanner. Initial implementations had every `clud` process open the redb file directly. This was unreliable under concurrent access: cross-platform advisory file locking is platform-specific, redb's own locking assumed single-process ownership, and we saw lock-contention hangs on Windows.

**Decision:** A single daemon process (`gc_daemon`) owns `~/.clud/data.redb` exclusively for its lifetime. All other `clud` processes (CLI commands, in-process worktree scanner) talk to the daemon via JSON line-delimited messages over a loopback TCP socket. The daemon serializes all redb access through a dedicated registry-worker thread. (Issue #135 Phase 1.)

The separate session-cap registry (`sessions.redb`) keeps file-lock-based serialization via a sidecar `sessions.lock` advisory lock (issue #138) because the cap-registry workload is much simpler — a per-launch row insert/remove that can tolerate brief blocking.

**Rationale:**
- One process owns the file → no cross-process locking required for the GC store.
- Loopback TCP gives us a well-understood IPC layer with no platform-specific code (Unix sockets vs named pipes).
- JSON line-delimited keeps the protocol debuggable and matches the daemon-ipc style elsewhere in clud.
- The cap-registry stays file-locked because its access pattern is rare and short; spinning a separate daemon for it would be overkill.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Continue with direct file access + advisory locks | Failed under concurrent invocations on Windows. |
| Use named pipes / Unix sockets directly | Platform-specific code; TCP loopback is portable and equally fast for this workload. **Superseded by [DD-025](#dd-025-the-broker-frame-lane-is-the-default-daemon-transport-superseding-dd-006s-tcp-only-rationale) — this is now the default path.** |
| Move everything to a single redb file with file locks | Doesn't solve the original concurrency problem. |
| Use sqlite or a daemon-less embedded DB with better locking | redb is already used elsewhere; introducing another store fragments storage. |

**Consequences:**
- An extra process (`gc_daemon`) runs in the background; users see it in process listings.
- The daemon binary is the same `clud` executable re-entered via a hidden subcommand, so there's no separate artifact to ship.
- Connection failure to the daemon is a soft error: `clud gc list` reports unavailable, doesn't crash the user's foreground command.
- See [gc-and-registry.md](architecture/gc-and-registry.md) for the protocol.

## DD-007: `lib.rs` is the only place that declares modules; `main.rs` imports through `clud::{…}`

**Context:** `clud-bin` has both a binary (`main.rs`) and a library target (`lib.rs`) because Rust integration tests under `tests/` can only link against the library. If `main.rs` declares `mod session;` and `lib.rs` also declares `mod session;`, those are two separate compilation units; static state diverges, traits implemented in one aren't recognized in the other.

**Decision:** Every top-level module declaration (`mod session;`, `mod runner;`, `mod command;`, …) lives in `lib.rs` only. `main.rs` does not declare any `mod` — it imports the modules it needs via `use clud::{…}`. Integration tests in `tests/*.rs` likewise link against `clud::…`.

**Rationale:**
- Single instantiation of every module: no duplicate static state, no trait-impl mismatches between binary and tests.
- Tests can exercise internals (`session::run_raw_pty_pump`, `session::F3Observer`) by linking the library.
- Refactors that move code only need to update one declaration site.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Declare in both `main.rs` and `lib.rs` | The duplicate-instantiation problem above. |
| Declare in `main.rs` only | Tests can't import internals; would force a public-API split. |
| Make `clud-bin` a library only and have a separate `clud-cli` binary crate | More crates, slower builds, more crate-boundary friction. |

**Consequences:**
- New top-level modules require editing `lib.rs`, not `main.rs`. Easy to forget; PR review must catch.
- `main.rs` becomes a thin orchestration file rather than the project's hub. `lib.rs` is where the structural map lives.

## DD-008: Dual skill installer (`skills.rs` vs `skill_install.rs`) — interim state

**Status:** Superseded by [DD-039](#dd-039-bundled-skills-have-exactly-one-source-of-truth) and [DD-040](#dd-040-clud-pr-clud-fix-clud-do-and-clud-pr-merge-are-retired-in-favor-of-goal). The body below is kept as history; `skill_install.rs` and the top-level `skills/` tree no longer exist.

**Context:** Skills are slash-commands (`/clud-pr`, `/clud-issue`, etc.) bundled into the `clud` binary via `include_str!` and installed into the user's backend home(s) during global launch setup. Session-only launches do not write persistent skill files. Two installer implementations exist in the codebase today:

- `src/skills.rs` - multi-backend (`~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/` gated by `~/.codex`), non-overwriting (preserves user edits), reads from `crates/clud-bin/assets/skills/`, and purges stale clud-managed copies from `~/.agents/skills/` (see [DD-013](#dd-013-codex-skills-install-to-codexskills-mirror-of-claude)).
- `src/skill_install.rs` - Claude-only (`~/.claude/skills/`), overwrites on semantic divergence (whitespace-tolerant compare), reads from a separate top-level `skills/` directory, and purges retired managed skills from `PURGED_SKILLS`.

Their `BUNDLED_SKILLS` constants ship different subsets of skills.

**Decision:** Accept the remaining duality as interim state. Both installers remain registered behind the launch setup scope gate, and global setup runs only the selected backend's actions. Document the divergence explicitly in [skill-system.md](architecture/skill-system.md) and the dir READMEs so contributors aren't surprised. Retire merged skills through `skill_install.rs`'s `PURGED_SKILLS` list; `/clud-pr-merge` has already been folded into `/clud-pr` PR merge mode and added to that purge list. Plan to consolidate the remaining duplicate source trees later (single installer, single source tree).

**Rationale:**
- The two installers evolved independently — `skill_install.rs` predates `skills.rs` — and fully consolidating now would be a non-trivial change with its own design questions (which overwrite policy wins? which source tree?).
- Documenting the current state immediately is cheap; consolidating prematurely risks losing user edits or shipping the wrong subset.
- The non-overwriting behavior of `skills.rs` is the right policy for skills the user might edit; the overwrite behavior of `skill_install.rs` is the right policy for skills clud strictly owns. The eventual consolidation needs to preserve both modes.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Consolidate now | Requires deciding overwrite policy and source-tree layout under time pressure; risks regression. |
| Delete one installer | Either drops Codex support (`skill_install.rs` alone) or drops semantic overwrite (`skills.rs` alone). |

**Consequences:**
- Two installer implementations remain live, but they run only during selected-backend global setup. Session-only launches skip both.
- Adding a new skill may require editing one or both `BUNDLED_SKILLS` constants depending on backend coverage and drift semantics. Retiring a skill requires adding it to `PURGED_SKILLS`. [skill-system.md](architecture/skill-system.md) documents the checklist.
- This DD should be revisited when consolidation lands; mark superseded then.

## DD-009: Cooperative Ctrl+C via `Arc<AtomicBool>` + best-effort descendant kill via `process_tree::kill_tree`

**Context:** clud has long-running operations (loop iterations, daemon attach, GC scan) that the user might interrupt with Ctrl+C. The interrupt needs to propagate to backend processes and clean up child processes (especially on Windows where `clud --codex` spawns `cmd.exe → node.exe`, which can orphan if the parent dies first). A tokio-style cancellation-token system would require pulling tokio into every code path.

**Decision:** Two mechanisms working together:

1. **Cooperative flag.** `startup::install_ctrlc_flag()` installs a Ctrl+C handler that sets a shared `Arc<AtomicBool>`. The flag is consumed by the iteration loop in `runner.rs`, the daemon attach loop in `daemon/attach.rs`, and the GC scanner thread in `gc/scanner.rs`. Each polling site checks the flag and exits gracefully.
2. **Best-effort descendant reap.** On exit, `process_tree::kill_tree` (via `sysinfo`) walks descendants of the current process and kills them. This fixes the multi-second Ctrl+C hang seen on Windows where `cmd.exe → node.exe` orphans the real child if only the immediate child is killed.

**Rationale:**
- The flag is dependency-free and works in sync and async code identically.
- `kill_tree` is best-effort because process trees can race (a child spawns a grandchild between enumeration and kill). Acceptable: the user's intent is "stop now"; a stray surviving process is a smaller failure mode than a several-second hang.
- Together they cover the realistic Ctrl+C scenarios without forcing every module onto tokio.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| `tokio::select!` with cancellation tokens | Forces tokio onto sync code paths; large refactor for marginal benefit. |
| Job objects (Windows) / process groups (Unix) | Platform-specific; more complex; doesn't avoid the need for an AtomicBool for sync poll sites. |
| Send SIGTERM to PID and wait | Doesn't reach grandchildren; the original codex orphan problem. |

**Consequences:**
- Every long-running loop must remember to poll the flag. If a loop forgets, Ctrl+C feels slow.
- `kill_tree` can produce stderr noise from `sysinfo` access errors on locked-down systems; suppressed where benign.

---

## DD-010: `testbins/` lives outside `crates/` for non-shipping binaries

**Context:** clud has a `mock-agent` crate that pretends to be `claude`/`codex` during integration tests. It's a Rust binary, a workspace member, and a real Cargo crate — but it's never shipped to users.

**Decision:** Test-only Rust binaries live in `testbins/` (workspace members declared in the root `Cargo.toml`), separate from `crates/` which holds the shipped binary (`clud-bin`).

**Rationale:**
- The directory name communicates intent: anything under `crates/` ships, anything under `testbins/` does not.
- Newcomers reading the repo layout immediately understand the distinction without checking each crate's `publish = false` line.
- Release tooling can mass-include `crates/*` and ignore `testbins/*` without per-crate logic.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Put `mock-agent` in `crates/mock-agent` with `publish = false` | Easy to miss the `publish = false`; mixes shipping and non-shipping crates in one directory. |
| Inline mock binary inside `clud-bin/tests/` | Cargo doesn't compile test directories as separate binaries you can find on `PATH`. The test would need to invoke the mock via library functions, which loses the integration-test value. |
| Separate test-only workspace | Two workspaces is more painful than one with a directory convention. |

**Consequences:**
- Build commands need `-p mock-agent` to target it, but that's already standard Cargo.
- Anyone adding a new test binary should put it in `testbins/`, not `crates/`. See `testbins/README.md`.

## DD-011: Centralized session daemon is default for interactive launches; piped invocations stay on the direct runner

**Context:** clud has two paths a user-facing session can take. The **direct runner** (`runner::run_plan_{subprocess,pty}`) spawns the backend straight from the foreground `clud` process; clean and low-overhead for a one-shot prompt. The **centralized daemon** (`daemon::run_centralized_session` → `attach_to_session`) puts a long-lived daemon between the user and the backend; gains attach/detach, kill-on-close Job Object lifetime, session listing, replay, and a uniform place to wire voice + DnD. Up through PR2 the centralized path was opt-in (`--detach`, `--experimental-daemon-centralized`, `CLUD_EXPERIMENTAL_DAEMON=1`); everything else used the direct runner.

**Decision:** Centralized is now the **default for interactive launches** — when both stdin and stdout are TTYs. Non-interactive (piped) invocations keep using the direct runner. Explicit opt-out via `--no-daemon` or `CLUD_NO_DAEMON=1`; legacy `--experimental-daemon-centralized` / `CLUD_EXPERIMENTAL_DAEMON=1` stay as forced-on aliases for back-compat.

**Rationale:**

- Every meaningful win of the centralized path (durable session, attach later, kill-on-close, session list, voice + DnD parity) only matters when there's a human at the keyboard.
- For piped one-shots the direct runner produces byte-identical stdio framing that shell pipelines and CI test harnesses depend on. Routing those through the daemon adds a TCP round-trip and an extra base64-on-pipe layer without any user-visible benefit.
- The TTY-pair check (`io::stdin().is_terminal() && io::stdout().is_terminal()`) is the cheapest, most reliable interactive-detector available and is already used elsewhere in clud (`session::terminals_are_interactive`).
- Keeps the integration test surface stable: every test that pipes its child's stdio (essentially all of `test_mock_agents.py`) stays on the direct runner without per-test annotation.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Flip the default unconditionally (centralized everywhere) | 43 integration tests broke on the trial run because they implicitly assert direct-mode behavior (stderr message wording, stdio framing). Either each test grows a `CLUD_NO_DAEMON=1` annotation or every test's expectations need updating — both invasive enough to justify the TTY-gate compromise. |
| Keep centralized opt-in indefinitely | Users with `clud foo` at the prompt should get the better experience by default; making them set an env var to opt in is friction nothing has shipped to justify. |
| Use a separate `--centralized` flag instead of repurposing `--no-daemon` | Two flags governing the same axis (`--centralized` vs `--no-daemon`) is the kind of UI papercut that compounds. `--no-daemon` already existed for the gc-daemon opt-out; extending its meaning to "skip both daemons" matches user intent: if you said no-daemon, you meant *no* daemon. |

**Consequences:**

- `clud foo` at an interactive terminal now talks to a background daemon; the daemon process becomes visible in `ps`/Task Manager. The same daemon already existed for `--detach` users — this just expands its audience.
- A first-touch `clud` may pay a one-time ~50 ms `ensure_daemon` cost while the daemon spawns. Subsequent invocations within the same session reuse the running daemon.
- `clud -p "x" | jq` and other piped uses are unchanged from the direct-runner era; no daemon involvement.
- The `experimental_enabled` function name is now misleading (centralized is no longer experimental). The function is preserved for one external call site in `main.rs` and can be renamed in a follow-up cleanup; touching its body without renaming keeps PR3's diff focused.

## DD-012: One always-on daemon hosts both session ops and the GC registry

**Context:** Phase 1 of issue #135 shipped a standalone `gc_daemon` process that owned `~/.clud/data.redb` and served `clud gc *` IPC ops (see [DD-006](#dd-006--cluddataredb-is-owned-exclusively-by-a-single-gc-daemon-process-clients-access-it-over-loopback-tcp)). Separately, the centralized session daemon (`daemon/`) hosted `--detach` / `attach` / `list` / `kill` / `logs` / repeat jobs but was opt-in. Two daemons per user meant two info files, two TCP ports, two lifecycles to debug, and two startup races — and the user instinct was always "there's only one clud daemon, right?"

PR #151 tried to make the session daemon the default for interactive launches but had to be reverted in PR #152 because the attach pump (`run_remote_interactive`) drops DSR/DA/OSC replies via `crossterm::event`. With the centralized-by-default plan off the table, the always-on slot was empty.

**Decision:** Merge `gc_daemon` into the session daemon. There is now exactly one `clud` daemon process per user, auto-spawned from `main.rs` on every non-`--no-daemon` / non-`--dry-run` invocation. It serves the existing `Create` / `Session` / `Terminate` ops plus a new `Gc { payload }` variant that routes to a registry-worker thread inside the same process. Foreground interactive launches still use the direct runner (until the attach pump is rewritten); the daemon hosts the centralized PTY path only when explicitly opted in (`--detach`, `--detachable`, `--experimental-daemon-centralized`, repeat jobs).

This supersedes the "separate GC daemon" half of [DD-006](#dd-006--cluddataredb-is-owned-exclusively-by-a-single-gc-daemon-process-clients-access-it-over-loopback-tcp) — the single-owner-of-redb invariant survives, only the owning process identity changed. The `gc_daemon.rs` module and `__gc-daemon` hidden subcommand are gone.

**Rationale:**

- One process per user matches the user's mental model and halves the surface area for "is the daemon up?" diagnostics.
- redb's single-process-ownership invariant is preserved: the registry worker thread is still the sole reader/writer of the file.
- The session daemon's existing infrastructure (`ensure_daemon`, `trampoline::spawn_detached_self`, info file, stale-state cleanup) covers everything the standalone GC daemon needed.
- Auto-spawning the session daemon unconditionally (not just when GC is touched) means later phases of #135 (background reapers, graveyard) have a host process that's already running and warm.
- Avoids spawning two separate detached children from the same parent, which previously destabilized the freshly-spawned session worker on Linux (per the deleted "skip when `experimental_enabled`" comment in `main.rs`).

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Keep both daemons | The maintenance and UX cost (two info files, two ports, two race windows, two readme entries) compounds with every reaper/graveyard feature added to either. |
| Merge under `gc_daemon` instead of under `daemon/` | The session daemon has the richer feature set (PTY worker subprocesses, attach pump, snapshot/log persistence) and a stable IPC enum protocol; lifting GC into it is a smaller diff than lifting session-management into `gc_daemon`. |
| Run GC inside the session daemon only when `experimental_enabled` is true | Keeps GC unavailable in the common case (foreground direct-runner launches). Defeats the always-on goal. |
| Add a `--daemon=gc` / `--daemon=session` mode flag and keep two binaries | The mode flag was the design in #135 §1 but added complexity (one binary, two long-lived state directories) for no end-user benefit. |

**Consequences:**

- Daemon state dir is now `~/.clud/state/` (persistent) instead of `$TMP/clud-daemon` (transient). Survives reboots; aligns with the GC daemon's prior location so the redb file stays put.
- `clud --no-daemon` and `CLUD_NO_DAEMON=1` now skip both spawn and registry access. `clud gc *` with `--no-daemon` is an error (no read-only fallback, unchanged from prior).
- One-time migration: users with a running pre-merge `gc_daemon` process will hit a redb lock conflict on first post-merge run; the old process idle-shuts after its 30-min window or can be killed manually. The redb file itself is forward-compatible.
- DD-006's "single owner" promise is intact; only the process identity moved. DD-011's "centralized as interactive default" remains reverted (per PR #152) and is independent of this change.

## DD-013: Codex skills install to `~/.codex/skills/`, mirror of Claude

**Context:** Clud bundles `SKILL.md` playbooks for `/clud-issue`, `/clud-review`, etc. inside the binary and writes them to per-backend user directories during global setup. PR #243 (closing issue #241) moved the Codex install target from `~/.codex/skills/` to `~/.agents/skills/`, on the belief that Codex had adopted a shared cross-vendor `~/.agents/` convention. In practice, Codex CLI loads skills from `~/.codex/skills/` and never consulted `~/.agents/skills/`. The visible symptom: `clud --codex -p "/clud-issue <issue>"` did not resolve `/clud-issue` even though the SKILL.md was installed — Codex never looked at the file. Reported in #289; meta burn-down at #299.

**Decision:** Codex skills install to `~/.codex/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, the same layout Claude uses at `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. Existing clud-managed copies under `~/.agents/skills/` are purged best-effort on first Codex global setup after upgrade (`purge_stale_agents_skills` in `skills.rs`). The purge applies the same conservative rules as the prior `~/.codex/skills/` purge: only delete a `SKILL.md` that contains the `managed-by: clud` marker and lives under a currently bundled skill name; leave unrelated files and user-authored skills alone.

**Rationale:**

- The whole point of installing the file is for the backend to find and execute it. Installing somewhere the backend ignores is worse than not installing at all — it consumes disk, suggests false coverage in tests, and masks the real bug.
- Mirroring Claude's layout eliminates a backend-specific branch in `SKILL_BACKENDS`: both entries now use `skills_home_subdir: None` (the field stays for future backends whose skills live outside their config root).
- Skip-if-exists still preserves user-edited skills at the new location.
- The cleanup of `~/.agents/skills/` is symmetric to the prior `~/.codex/skills/` cleanup pattern, so users upgrading don't end up with stale duplicates.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Keep installing to `~/.agents/skills/` and add runtime slash-command expansion inside `push_prompt` (intercept `/clud-issue ...` and inline the SKILL.md body before passing to `codex exec`) | Doubles the surface area (install path + runtime translation), tightly couples `command/prompts.rs` to skill discovery, and gives nothing for interactive Codex users. The install-to-the-right-place approach is strictly simpler. |
| Install to both `~/.codex/skills/` and `~/.agents/skills/` | Two copies on disk drift apart over time when users edit one. No real consumer of `~/.agents/skills/` has been identified. Add a second target only when a real need surfaces. |
| Install to `~/.codex/prompts/<name>.md` (Codex's documented custom-prompts location) | Requires a different format (plain markdown, no YAML frontmatter, no trigger metadata) and loses skill semantics. Worth revisiting separately if Codex's skill loader ever changes. |

**Consequences:**

- `clud --codex -p "/clud-issue 123"` works end-to-end on first global setup after upgrade.
- Users currently holding clud-managed copies under `~/.agents/skills/` see them removed on the next Codex global setup. User-authored content under that path is preserved.
- `SKILL_BACKENDS` Codex entry now sets `skills_home_subdir: None`. The `skills_home_subdir` field remains on `SkillBackend` for future backends that need it; a unit test (`skills_dir_honors_skills_home_subdir_override`) keeps that contract exercised.
- Reverses the install-path decision made in #241/#243 but retains the symmetric one-time cleanup behavior, just pointed at the other directory.

**Verification (added 2026-06-07, Codex CLI 0.137.0, closes #290):**

Three independent lines of evidence confirm Codex CLI loads skills from `~/.codex/skills/`, not `~/.agents/skills/`:

1. **Embedded path literals in the Codex binary.** Running `strings` on `codex.exe` (npm package `@openai/codex@0.137.0`, file `vendor/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/bin/codex.exe`) finds the literal path:
   ```
   ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/.system/imagegen/scripts/remove_chroma_key.py
   ```
   Codex's own built-in `imagegen` system skill lives under `$HOME/.codex/skills/.system/`. The skill loader does not look at `~/.agents/skills/`.
2. **System-skills marker.** The same binary contains the strings `create system skills subdir`, `create system skills file parent`, `write system skill file`, and `.codex-system-skills.marker` — all rooted at `$HOME/.codex/skills/`.
3. **Plugin/skill telemetry types.** Symbols like `codex_app_server_protocol::protocol::v2::plugin::SkillsListParams`, `SkillsExtraRootsSetParams`, and `SkillsConfigWriteParams` confirm `~/.codex/skills/` is the canonical root, with extra roots optionally configurable on top (not the other way around).

`~/.agents/skills/` appears nowhere in the Codex binary's path literals. The pre-#243 layout was the right one all along.

Note: this entry replaces what would have been [#290](https://github.com/zackees/clud/issues/290)'s separate verification spike — the binary-strings evidence is stronger than a black-box repro run, since it shows the source-of-truth path Codex's loader was built against.

## DD-014: Repo-scoped clud config lives at `.clud/settings.json` (mirrors `.claude/settings.json`)

**Context:** zackees/clud#343 wires up a repo-scoped opt-in marker so that when a developer checks out a repo, `clud` can transparently route Rust toolchain calls (cargo / rustc / rustfmt / clippy-driver / rustdoc) through [soldr](https://github.com/zackees/soldr) by prepending soldr's shim dir to the session `PATH`. The design needs a single, unambiguous file at the repo root that:

1. Declares the opt-in (presence + explicit field).
2. Carries forward-compatible structured fields (the `rust` section: `use_soldr`, `install`, optional `version` pin — and room for future `python`, `js`, etc.).
3. Doesn't collide with existing repo dot-conventions.
4. Reads symmetrically with the `.claude/` convention developers using Claude Code already know.

Earlier drafts considered `.clud` (bare file), `.clud.toml`, and `.clud/config.toml`. All three either collided with an existing path (the `.clud/` directory was previously gitignored and used for `/clud-loop` runtime state) or broke symmetry with the `.claude/settings.json` pattern.

**Decision:** Put the file at `.clud/settings.json`. The `.clud/` directory is now tracked (not blanket-gitignored). Inside it:

- `.clud/settings.json` — tracked. The repo-scoped opt-in marker + structured config.
- `.clud/settings.local.json` — gitignored. User-local overrides (mirrors `.claude/settings.local.json`).
- `.clud/loop/` and any other runtime state — gitignored via `.clud/*` plus `!.clud/settings.json` allowlist.

Parser lives in [`crates/clud-bin/src/repo_clud_config.rs`](../crates/clud-bin/src/repo_clud_config.rs); session activator lives in [`crates/clud-bin/src/soldr_activate.rs`](../crates/clud-bin/src/soldr_activate.rs); main.rs calls `soldr_activate::activate_soldr_shims_if_requested()` right after `trampoline::unlock_exe()`.

Schema (v1 activation shape):

```json
{
  "rust": {
    "use_soldr": true,
    "install":   true,
    "version":   "0.7.55"
  }
}
```

`clud optimize rust` also writes the equivalent current-main shape under
`optimize.rust`:

```json
{
  "optimize": {
    "rust": {
      "use_soldr_shims": true,
      "install_soldr": true
    }
  }
}
```

The parser accepts both forms. Direct `rust` keys win over `optimize.rust`
keys inside the same file; repo-level values still win over user-level values
per field. Omitting the version is the rolling-latest policy; `"latest"` is an
equivalent case-insensitive alias. A numeric version is a minimum, not an
exact pin ([DD-149](#dd-149-a-configured-soldr-version-is-a-minimum-a-launch-never-downgrades-soldr)).

**Rationale:**

- **Symmetry with `.claude/settings.json`.** Developers using Claude Code already understand `.claude/settings.json` as the "tracked, repo-scoped, JSON" config + `.claude/settings.local.json` as "gitignored local overrides". `.clud/settings.json` reuses that mental model verbatim. The `.gitignore` allowlist pattern is identical (`.clud/*` + `!.clud/settings.json` + `.clud/settings.local.json`).
- **Directory, not bare file.** `.clud/` as a directory lets us grow new files later (`hooks/`, `commands/`, `agents/`, runtime state under `loop/`) without inventing a second top-level marker.
- **JSON, not TOML.** JSON matches `.claude/settings.json` and the newer `~/.clud/settings.json` global settings file. `.clud/settings.json` may be generated or edited by tools, so JSON's strict syntax (no comments, explicit quoting) is the right trade-off when both humans and machines read/write it.
- **`rust` nesting from day one.** Even though only the Rust activation section exists today, scoping under `"rust"` means future `"python"` / `"js"` sections don't collide with `"use_soldr"` style top-level keys.
- **Soldr stays passive.** Soldr exposes only `soldr shims --json`. clud is the active consumer: clud reads `.clud/settings.json`, decides whether to call soldr, prepends `PATH`. Soldr knows nothing about `.clud/settings.json`. This dependency direction lets soldr-only consumers (no clud) call `soldr shims --json` themselves from any setup script.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| `.clud` (bare file at repo root) | Collides with the pre-existing `.clud/` directory used by `/clud-loop` for runtime state. Either every consumer has to handle file-vs-dir ambiguity per-checkout, or we ship a migration. Cleaner to use the directory we already have. |
| `.clud.toml` (file, distinct from `.clud/` dir) | No directory growth path. We'd need a second marker the moment we want `.clud/hooks/` or `.clud/commands/`. Splits the convention across two top-level paths. |
| `.clud/config.toml` (TOML inside the dir) | Loses symmetry with `.claude/settings.json`. Developers already know the `.claude/` layout; the `.clud/` layout should read the same way without forcing a second mental model. |
| Reuse `.claude/settings.json` with a new `"clud"` section | Crosses tool ownership. `.claude/settings.json` is Claude Code's file; adding clud-specific keys to it makes both tools' configs fragile to the other's schema evolution. clud should own its own file. |
| `~/.clud/settings.json` (user-level only, no repo file) | Misses the per-repo opt-in case — a developer who wants soldr routing for one Rust repo but not another can't express that with a user-level setting alone. The user-level file (owned by `clud_settings.rs`) and the repo-level file (`.clud/settings.json`, this DD) coexist; repo wins per field for soldr activation. |

**Consequences:**

- **`.gitignore` change.** The `.clud/` blanket-ignore is replaced by `.clud/*` + `!.clud/settings.json` + `.clud/settings.local.json` (mirroring `.claude/*`). Existing `/clud-loop` runtime state under `.clud/loop/` stays gitignored via the wildcard.
- **Session startup grows a fixed-cost probe.** `discover_repo_clud_config()` does an O(1) `fs::metadata` per parent dir up to the `.git` boundary. Negligible (~tens of microseconds), but it's a new mandatory step in the startup path. Repos without `.clud/settings.json` pay only the directory-walk; no `soldr` spawn happens.
- **Soldr's own `.clud/settings.json` is its dogfood.** This PR adds a `.clud/settings.json` to the clud repo itself declaring both `rust.use_soldr = true` and the current `optimize.rust.use_soldr_shims = true` shape, so every clud contributor's session automatically routes cargo through soldr per CLAUDE.md.
- **Global settings must opt in explicitly.** `~/.clud/settings.json` now stores many unrelated clud preferences. The activation parser ignores a user-level file unless it contains a soldr directive (`rust.*` or `optimize.rust.*`), preventing unrelated global settings from enabling soldr in every repo. Repo-level `.clud/settings.json` remains the presence-based opt-in marker for #343.
- **Reversal cost is moderate.** Renaming to a different filename later is a one-PR rename. Switching to TOML would mean a parser swap and rewriting `.clud/settings.json` to `.clud/settings.toml` everywhere — also one PR. Schema additions are append-only thanks to `#[serde(default)]` on every field.

**Verification:** `crates/clud-bin/src/repo_clud_config.rs` ships unit tests covering:

- Empty repo file = defaults (presence-only contract).
- Missing `rust` section = defaults for repo files (forward-compat for future sections).
- `optimize.rust` aliases emitted by `clud optimize rust`.
- Direct `rust` keys win over `optimize.rust` aliases.
- Unrelated user-level settings do not enable global soldr activation.
- Explicit `use_soldr=false` honored.
- Discovery walks up from a subdirectory.
- Discovery stops at the `.git/` boundary (no cross-repo bleed).
- Malformed JSON warns + returns `None`.

`crates/clud-bin/src/soldr_activate.rs` covers the activator failure-mode contract per zackees/clud#343.

## DD-015: Uncovered-disk-sink sweeps are env-var-gated, background-threaded, and disk-pressure-prioritized

**Context:** zackees/clud#511 (rolling up #509 + #510) closes the two biggest holes in clud's disk reclamation: the OS temp scatter of a session's backend agent, and stale Rust `target/` output under dev roots. Neither has a redb registry row, so the tracked-entry GC never sees them. The daemon already runs filesystem-only sweeps (uv-cache, #423), which is the pattern these extend.

Three questions had non-obvious answers:

1. **Config surface.** The issues sketched a typed `settings.json` section. But every existing knob in this exact subsystem (`CLUD_GC_TICK_SECS`, `CLUD_GC_WARN_FREE_GB`, `CLUD_GC_MIN_AGE_HOURS`, …) is an env var read in `gc_service.rs`. Adding typed settings + `KNOWN_TOP_LEVEL_KEYS` plumbing for these would have been net-new surface inconsistent with the neighbors.

2. **Blocking.** A `target/` walk over several dev roots can take real wall-clock and does `remove_dir_all`. Running it inline in the registry tick loop would stall unrelated GC ops (worktree/extern purges, the disk watchdog).

3. **When to run.** Reclamation should be aggressive under disk pressure but must not compete with an active build for CPU the rest of the time.

**Decision:**

- **Env-var config**, matching the subsystem convention: `CLUD_SESSION_TMP` (opt-out, default on), `CLUD_GC_TARGET_ROOTS` (opt-in; unset ⇒ target sweep is a no-op), `CLUD_GC_TARGET_STALE_DAYS` (default 14), `CLUD_GC_SWEEP_MAX_CPU_PCT` (default 60). Sweep logic lives in `crate::gc::{session_tmp,target_sweep}`; the daemon schedulers (`daemon/{session_tmp_sweep,target_sweep}.rs`) mirror `uv_cache_sweep`'s sentinel-throttle shape.
- **Background thread.** The tick calls `spawn_maintenance_sweeps`, which fans the two heavy sweeps onto a detached `clud-gc-sweep` thread guarded by an `AtomicBool` (no overlapping sweeps). The registry tick loop returns immediately.
- **Prioritization** (`maintenance_action`, pure + unit-tested): disk low (free below `CLUD_GC_WARN_FREE_GB` on the `~/.clud` volume or any target root) ⇒ run now, bypassing the per-sweep sentinel; otherwise run only when global CPU is under the ceiling, else defer to the next tick. The ~200ms CPU sample runs on the background thread, never the tick.

**Session temp default-on** is deliberate (the user asked for the redirect to be the default behavior), but every failure path is soft: no home dir, unwritable volume, or `CLUD_SESSION_TMP=0` all just leave the OS temp dir in place — a session launch never fails because of this. **Target reclamation default-off** because, unlike disposable temp, dropping `target/` forces a rebuild; the 14-day mtime gate is the cheap stand-in for "no live build owns this."

The `SESSION_TMP_STALE_AFTER` (48h) and `target_sweep` day-gate are **separate constants** from `PERIODIC_GC_WORKTREE_STALE_AFTER`, not a shared symbol — the policies only coincide in value today and will diverge.

See [gc-and-registry.md → Filesystem sweeps](architecture/gc-and-registry.md#filesystem-sweeps-non-registry).

## DD-016: `bad_commands` — generic, config-driven "bad command → blessed replacement" rules in `.clud/settings.json`

**Context:** zackees/clud#519. The `block-bad-cmd` PreToolUse hook (`crates/clud-bin/src/block_bad_cmd.rs`) already enforced one hardcoded rule shape — bare Rust-toolchain calls (`cargo`, `rustc`, …) are denied with a message telling the agent to prefix with `soldr`. Other repos need the identical enforcement shape for entirely different, repo-specific command pairs (motivating example: banning bare `playwright` in favor of a project's faster `npm run test:integration` pipeline) — a rule that has nothing to do with Rust and can't live in clud's compiled binary.

**Decision:** Add a `bad_commands` array to `.clud/settings.json` (see DD-014 for the two-level user/repo config this extends). Each entry:

```json
{
  "bad_commands": [
    {
      "id": "no-raw-playwright",
      "match": "playwright",
      "match_mode": "glob",
      "replacement": "npm run test:integration",
      "reason": "use the blessed pipeline; raw playwright is slower",
      "passthrough_prefixes": ["soldr"],
      "allow_override": true
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`match`** — a pattern for the normalized program-name token (`program_name(words[0])`), never the raw command line. This is deliberate: matching only the head token is what makes `rg playwright` / `grep -r playwright .` (searching *for* the word) correctly stay allowed, since their head token is `rg`/`grep`, not `playwright`. `match_mode` is `"glob"` by default (`*`/`?`/`[...]`, always whole-token-anchored — never a substring/prefix match) or `"regex"` to opt one rule into a raw regex pattern (also whole-token-anchored automatically).
- **`replacement`** / **`reason`** — populate the deny message: `"{reason} Use `{replacement}` instead."`.
- **`passthrough_prefixes`** (optional, same `match_mode` as the rule) — soldr-style transparent wrappers. When the current head token matches one of a rule's own passthrough prefixes, *that rule* is excluded from the rest of the segment's evaluation and the scan advances to the next token — so `soldr playwright run` is allowed for a rule that lists `soldr` as a passthrough prefix, without blanket-exempting *other* rules from matching whatever `soldr` wraps.
- **`allow_override`** (optional, default `false`) — per-rule opt-in for the override escape hatch: `CLUD_BAD_CMD_OVERRIDE="<rule-id>:<reason>"` set as a **real process environment variable** (never parsed out of the command text — text-parsing it would race the hook's own env-assignment stripping in `command_words()`). The reason is mandatory; a missing/empty reason is treated as no override. Every accepted or rejected override attempt is logged.

**Merge semantics differ from the scalar `rust.*` fields:** `bad_commands` **concatenates** repo-level and user-level rules (both are active) rather than repo-overrides-user per field, since two independent rule sets should compose. Rules are deduped by `id` — a repo-level rule sharing an `id` with a user-level rule replaces it wholesale; `id`-less rules never dedupe. `has_directive` (renamed from `has_soldr_directive`) now also treats a non-empty `bad_commands` array as a valid activation signal, so a user-level file containing only `bad_commands` (no `rust` key) still counts.

**Command-substitution / nested-shell recursion:** the existing per-segment scan (chaining on `;`/`&&`/`||`/`|`, nested `bash -c`/`cmd /c`/`powershell -Command` unwrapping) is reused as-is for generic rules. It's additionally extended to recurse into `` `...` `` / `$(...)` command substitution (excluding `$((...))` arithmetic expansion), `<(...)`/`>(...)` process substitution, and `eval "..."`, bounded by a recursion-depth cap (`MAX_SUBSTITUTION_RECURSION_DEPTH = 8`) that fails open (allows + logs) rather than denying or risking a stack overflow on pathological input — this hook is a friction-reducing nudge for a cooperative agent, not a security sandbox. Deliberate evasion (variable indirection, encoded/computed command strings, alternate-interpreter smuggling) is explicitly out of scope. Heredoc bodies (`<<'EOF' ... EOF`) are stripped before segment-scanning so their contents are never treated as invocations.

**Relationship to the hardcoded Rust rules:** `RUST_TOOLS` / `LEGACY_RUST_TRAMPOLINES` / the hybrid-`uv run` heuristic stay as their own hardcoded fast path, not migrated into the generic rule format — they carry bespoke logic and deny wording asserted verbatim by existing tests that doesn't cleanly fit a flat matcher→replacement→reason→passthrough→override shape. Generic rules run as an *additional* check in the same per-segment loop.

**Verification:** `crates/clud-bin/src/block_bad_cmd.rs` and `crates/clud-bin/src/repo_clud_config.rs` ship unit tests covering positional (not substring) matching, chaining/segment scanning, nested-shell and command-substitution recursion, arithmetic-expansion exclusion, glob vs. regex `passthrough_prefixes`, the override env-var contract (id match, mandatory reason, per-rule opt-in), config concatenation/dedup, and non-regression on the full pre-existing hardcoded-Rust test suite.

## DD-017: Dangerous arguments use token predicates; dangerous pipelines are separate rules

**Context:** zackees/clud#526. Executable-only rules cannot distinguish safe and dangerous invocations of the same program (`git push` vs. `git push --force`), and raw command-line regexes would reintroduce quoting and substring false positives that DD-016 deliberately avoided. Some hazards are relationships between processes (`curl ... | sh`), not properties of either executable alone.

**Decision:** A `bad_commands` entry may add an `arguments` object evaluated against the already-tokenized arguments after the executable. String patterns are whole-token, case-insensitive globs. A single pattern may instead use `{"match":"...","match_mode":"regex"}`; mode is local to that pattern rather than inherited from the executable rule.

```json
{
  "bad_commands": [
    {
      "id": "no-force-push",
      "match": "git",
      "arguments": {
        "ordered": ["push"],
        "any": ["--force", "-f"],
        "none": ["--force-with-lease"]
      },
      "replacement": "git push --force-with-lease",
      "reason": "unconditional force pushes can overwrite remote work"
    },
    {
      "id": "no-recursive-root-delete",
      "match": "rm",
      "through_wrappers": ["sudo"],
      "arguments": {
        "all": ["/"],
        "any_of": [
          {"short_flags_all": ["r", "f"]},
          {"all": ["--recursive", "--force"]}
        ]
      },
      "replacement": "inspect the target and delete a narrower path"
    }
  ]
}
```

Predicates present in one object combine with AND. `prefix` is contiguous from the first argument; `ordered` permits intervening arguments; `contiguous` requires adjacency anywhere; `any`/`all`/`none` have their ordinary quantifier meanings; `any_of` ORs complete nested predicate objects. `short_flags_any` and `short_flags_all` are an explicit opt-in to POSIX short-option bundle interpretation, so `-rf`, `-fr`, and `-r -f` can be equivalent without assuming every CLI bundles short options. Recursive `any_of` parsing is capped at eight levels and malformed nested patterns skip only their containing rule.

`through_wrappers` is limited to parsers clud understands (`sudo`, `env`, `command`, `exec`). In particular, `sudo -u root rm ...`, `env -u HOME rm ...`, and `exec -a alias rm ...` consume wrapper option values before matching `rm`; `env -S` tokenizes its explicit split-string value. The previously supported `env`/`command`/`exec` wrappers remain universally transparent for backward compatibility, while `sudo` requires explicit rule opt-in. Arbitrary user-defined wrapper grammars are rejected rather than guessed.

Pipeline relationships live in a sibling `bad_pipelines` array. Stages are ordered and contiguous within a single-pipe chain; `;`, `&&`, and `||` terminate the chain. The lightweight shell scanner honors quoted pipes, comments, and the active dialect's escape character: Bash/POSIX (`\`), PowerShell (backtick), or cmd (caret). The hook tool selects the initial dialect: explicit tool names win, while Codex's generic `Shell`/`shell_command` maps to PowerShell on Windows and POSIX elsewhere. Explicit nested `bash`/`pwsh`/`cmd` wrappers switch dialects for their inner command. This avoids both literal-pipe false positives and cross-dialect escape bypasses. Each stage uses the same executable and optional argument matcher shape.

```json
{
  "bad_pipelines": [
    {
      "id": "no-download-to-shell",
      "stages": [
        {"match": "curl"},
        {"match": "^(?:ba)?sh$", "match_mode": "regex"}
      ],
      "replacement": "download the script, inspect it, then run it",
      "reason": "piping downloaded content into a shell hides executed code"
    }
  ]
}
```

Both arrays concatenate across user and repo settings and dedupe by `id` with the repo definition winning. Pipeline rules share the existing per-rule override behavior. Matching embedded programs (`python -c`, encoded `eval`, generated scripts), variable indirection, and deliberate evasion remain out of scope: these rules are cooperative guardrails, not a security sandbox.

## DD-018: PTY pump uses a dedicated stdout-writer thread fed by an unbounded channel, not a smaller output-read timeout

**Context:** zackees/clud#538. `run_raw_pty_pump_full_verbose`'s single loop did `read_chunk_impl → OSC-strip → write_all → flush()` to the real terminal *before* draining stdin each turn. Under high CPU load (the reported symptom, `clud --codex`), a slow terminal `flush()` blocked the same loop turn that would otherwise forward the next keystroke, and the loop's cadence was floored at the output read's 10 ms timeout regardless. Shrinking the timeout alone doesn't fix it — the write+flush is still inline ahead of stdin, so a genuinely slow terminal still stalls forwarding for however long `flush()` takes, timeout notwithstanding.

**Decision:** Split output handling onto two dedicated threads, opened via `std::thread::scope` (`process: &NativePtyProcess` is a borrow, not an owned `Arc`, and its fields are already internally `Mutex`/`Atomic`-guarded for concurrent access — see the existing `daemon/worker.rs` reader+writer pair):

- A **reader thread** calls `read_chunk_impl`, OSC-strips, and coalesces anything else already queued via non-blocking `read_chunk_impl(Some(0.0))` before sending once over an **unbounded** `mpsc` channel. Unbounded is load-bearing: `send` must never block, or a stalled writer would eventually stall the reader (and transitively the shutdown-detection path) exactly like the bug being fixed — just one hop removed instead of zero. The tradeoff is an unbounded memory backlog if the sink stalls indefinitely; acceptable because PTY output is bounded by what the child actually writes, and the writer thread only stalls on genuinely slow real terminals, not indefinitely.
- A **writer thread** (`run_output_writer`) blocks on the channel, drains everything else pending with `try_recv()`, and issues exactly one `write_all` + one `flush()` per wakeup — turning a burst of N chunks into O(1) syscalls instead of N unbuffered writes.
- The **main thread** never touches output. It blocks on `stdin_rx.recv_timeout(STDIN_IDLE_POLL)` (5 ms) instead of the old output-read timeout; `recv_timeout` wakes immediately once a chunk is sent, so the 5 ms bound only governs idle re-polling of resize/hooks/exit, not keystroke latency.

The destination writer is a generic parameter (`W: Write + Send`) rather than hardcoded `io::stdout()`, via a `#[doc(hidden)]` `..._for_test` seam — tests inject a slow or counting sink to verify the decoupling and the O(1)-flush property without needing to control real terminal I/O timing.

**Alternatives rejected:**
- *Just lower the 10 ms timeout.* Doesn't address the root cause (write+flush is still inline and blocking); only shrinks the idle floor, not the stall-while-flushing floor.
- *Bounded channel with a small capacity.* Reintroduces the coupling this fix removes — once the bound fills, `send` blocks and the reader (and eventually shutdown detection) stalls behind the same slow writer.
- *`Arc<NativePtyProcess>` + `thread::spawn` instead of `thread::scope`.* Would work, but `NativePtyProcess` is already passed around by borrow throughout `session.rs`, and every existing pump variant/test takes `&NativePtyProcess`; `thread::scope` gets the same concurrent-thread guarantee without changing that signature or adding reference counting.

## DD-019: Idle CPU measurements are standalone, machine-local baselines with opt-in budgets

**Context:** Idle-cost fixes in #542 need a repeatable end-to-end signal for
both client sessions and the detached daemon. A normal pytest case cannot own
that role: its global 90-second timeout is shorter than a representative
60-second sample plus setup and teardown, and absolute CPU measurements on
shared CI runners are noisy.

**Decision:** Keep the harness in `bench/idle_cpu` as `python -m
bench.idle_cpu.harness`. It uses the integration suite's mock-agent pattern to
start a fresh daemon and detached non-PTY sessions, samples cumulative
per-process CPU time through `psutil`, and counts appended daemon-event lines.
The report is JSON; its pure assembly and budget comparison live in
`report.py` and are covered by ordinary fast pytest tests. Committed N=1 and
N=8 reports are local reference baselines. Budget enforcement is explicitly
opt-in through `--budget` or `CLUD_BENCH_BUDGET=1`, allowing 20% CPU variation
and one event line.

**Consequences:** The harness is suitable for a quiet developer machine or a
scheduled dedicated runner, never default CI. Baselines must be refreshed only
with a documented, intentional idle-cost change. Once #543 and #544 remove the
current no-op GC event stream, its zero/near-zero event budget becomes a direct
regression guard for that churn.

## DD-020: The soldr build backend is pinned exactly, and CI's toolchain pin is asserted to match it

**Status:** Superseded by [DD-120](#dd-120-soldr-follows-rolling-latest-everywhere-superseding-dd-020). The body below is kept as history.

**Context:** `pyproject.toml` declared `requires = ["soldr>=0.8.27"]` with
`build-backend = "soldr"`. That line resolves the *build backend* from PyPI
independently, at build time — it is a different resolution from
`setup-soldr`'s `version:` input, which provisions the *toolchain* soldr in
CI. The two look like the same pin and behave nothing like it.

soldr 0.8.26 shipped a regression (zackees/soldr#1934) that made `cargo
metadata` fail before any compilation. Within hours every clud lane was red,
**including branches whose `setup-soldr` version was pinned to the known-good
0.8.25** — the failing shim path in those logs was `.../v0.8.26/shims/rustc`,
a version nothing in the repo asked for. The floor pin offered no protection
because 0.8.26 satisfied it, and neither would `<0.9` have: soldr's *patch*
releases carry build-system behaviour changes, so a compatible-release bound
is the wrong shape for this dependency.

The drift was also unobserved. `tests/test_packaging_metadata.py` did assert
on CI's soldr versions, but by substring (`"0.8.0" in line`), which
`"0.8.27"` does not contain — so the only line it actually inspected was
`dylint.yml`'s, and that lane had quietly sat on 0.8.0 while the rest of CI
moved to 0.8.27.

**Decision:** Pin the backend exactly (`soldr==0.8.28`, the current release)
and treat the backend pin, every checkable `setup-soldr` version under
`.github/`, and `./install`'s default as **one decision with three
spellings**. A composite action may forward an input into `with.version`, but
that input must have a literal default that can be compared with the pin.
`test_packaging_metadata.py::test_soldr_versions_move_in_lockstep` parses the
exact version out of `build-system.requires` and asserts all three declare it.
Two sites had already drifted unnoticed and are corrected here: `dylint.yml`
sat on 0.8.0, and `./install` on 0.7.11. Nothing caught either, because the
previous test compared by substring (`"0.8.0" in line`, which `"0.8.27"` does
not contain) and never looked outside `.github/workflows/`. The guard now
checks both workflows and composite actions, including the central
`setup-build` action's forwarded input default. It also rejects a non-exact
requirement outright, so reverting to a floor fails loudly rather than
silently reopening the hole, without asserting the active pin as a separate
test expectation that would become a fourth edit site.

Raising `./install` required a fix, not just a number: soldr 0.8.x stopped
publishing `.tar.gz`/`.zip` and ships `.tar.zst`, which needs a `zstd` binary
the script cannot assume — on git-bash, GNU tar 1.35 accepts `--zstd` and
then dies with `zstd: Cannot exec`. The script now prefers the release's
**wheel**, a plain zip carrying the same binary under
`soldr-<version>.data/scripts/`, extracted by the `unzip`-or-Python path it
already had; the legacy archive stays as a fallback for 0.7.x, which
published no wheels.
`test_install_script_uses_wheel_with_legacy_fallback` guards that asset
strategy, so the lockstep assertion cannot be satisfied by leaving the
installer on its legacy archive-only path.

One soldr version stays knowingly **outside** the lockstep set:
`crates/clud-bin/assets/tools/docker/docker_build_soldr.py`'s `ARG
SOLDR_VERSION`, which pins the soldr baked into the bundled Docker image and
is asserted as a literal by `crates/clud-bin/src/tools.rs`. It is bumped to
0.8.28 here, but folding it into the Python test would couple a Rust
guardrail to a packaging test for a lane that builds nothing this repo ships.
CLAUDE.md names it as an explicit exclusion so a bumper knows it exists.

Rejected alternatives: a floor-plus-patch-ceiling (`>=0.8.27,<0.8.28`) is an
exact pin with extra syntax; leaving it unbounded would only be defensible if
soldr's release gate built a downstream consumer, which it does not.

**Consequences:** clud no longer picks up soldr fixes automatically — during
this same incident the *fix* also arrived by publication, so a broken upstream
release now costs a deliberate bump PR either way. That is the trade being
bought: `main` cannot go red without a clud-side change first, and yesterday's
build is reproducible. Bumping soldr is one commit touching `pyproject.toml`,
every workflow, and `./install`; the test names each drifting site in its
failure message so none is forgotten. `dylint.yml`'s cache key embeds the
soldr version, so its first run after this change pays one cold build.

CI exercises both resolution paths. The wheel build invokes maturin directly,
but `bash test` builds and installs the local project through its PEP 517
backend after the initial dependency-only sync. The exact backend pin
therefore protects source installs and the test lanes, while the
`setup-soldr` pins protect every lane's Rust toolchain. That overlap is
exactly why the three spellings must not be allowed to drift apart.

## DD-021: Automatic Windows tool cleanup requires positive lifecycle roles

**Context:** zackees/clud#616. The #569 Job completion-port listener selected
tool shells by executable basename at every process depth. That recovered
genuine leaked `gh`/`git`/build clients, but it also made an ordinary nested
`cmd.exe` authoritative: when Python's `os.system("start cmd")` wrapper exited,
the intentionally detached terminal was killed. A related false-positive path
killed `conhost.exe`, which destroys the console and can leave its client
running headless. False positives are destructive, while a false negative costs
only deferred cleanup.

**Decision:** Backend authority starts with an explicit runner registration of
PID plus OS start time. The captured tree must then reach the exact agent host
(`codex.exe`, native `claude.exe`, or the npm Claude launcher's first
`node.exe`) before a direct child shell can receive the `ToolShellRoot` role.
The agent image is an authority boundary: any direct
non-shell child begins a `Client` subtree permanently, even when that child or
its descendants use familiar runtime/shell image names. Git Bash's direct
Bash-to-Bash re-exec transfers completion ownership. A nested shell beneath a
non-shell client is treated as an intentional detach boundary. Declared daemons
(`RUNNING_PROCESS_IS_DAEMON`) remain the positive escape contract for
long-lived services. `conhost.exe` is an unconditional pruned subtree and is
never terminated by automatic cleanup.

The complete role and exit decision is a pure function over captured process
metadata, registered backend identities, and the current declared-daemon set.
The Win32 completion-port listener only captures events, executes the plan, and
writes structured `reap` / `spare` / `handoff` records.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- *Keep basename matching and add more exclusions.* Depth remains ambiguous;
  every new wrapper creates another destructive special case.
- *Use the inherited CLUD originator tag as the detach signal.* Ordinary
  detached terminals and Docker helpers inherit it too, so it cannot
  distinguish intent.
- *Treat parent death as completion.* Git Bash re-exec makes a dead recorded
  parent part of healthy execution, and conhost's parent is its creator rather
  than its client.
- *Store bare backend PIDs.* Windows reuses PIDs; a stale registration could
  grant an unrelated process automatic-kill authority. Start time is part of
  the identity and a missing/mismatched identity fails closed.

**Consequences:** Automatic reaping remains prompt for direct agent tool-shell
leaks, while ambiguous nested/detached shapes survive. Some unmarked custom
daemon shapes can now be false negatives; callers that intentionally outlive a
tool must use the declared-daemon marker. Every decision is diagnosable from
the structured event log. Job PIDs whose metadata publication lags their
creation notification are retained and retried; an irrecoverable metadata miss
is logged and fails closed instead of inferring authority from the PID.
Non-Windows execution is unchanged.

## DD-022: The large-file guard reads the git index in-process, not the worktree

**Context:** zackees/clud#132's startup guard walked the whole worktree with the
`ignore` crate's parallel walker on **every** launch — ~240-400 ms locally and
~3.3 s over loopback SMB, paid synchronously before the backend starts, to
answer a question whose answer changes maybe weekly (issue #556, parent #551).
Four cheaper routes were benchmarked. Subprocess `git ls-files -z` plus a stat
per candidate lost at scale: two ~50-70 ms Windows spawns before any file work,
`--others --exclude-standard` is itself a single-threaded worktree traversal, and
`ls-files` output carries no sizes, so the git path tied or lost against the
walker on a 4416-file repo. ODB routes (`ls-files --format='%(objectsize)'`,
`ls-tree -l`) were 3-12x slower and can trigger remote fetches on partial clones.
`git ls-files --debug` was fast (52 ms) but spends ~30-50 ms on spawn+config,
emits ~6 text lines per file, and its format is documented unstable.

**Decision:** Parse `.git/index` in-process with `gix-index` (pinned exactly;
MIT OR Apache-2.0). The index already stores each tracked file's cached stat
size, so the tracked-file report needs no worktree I/O, no ODB, no hashing and
no subprocess — ~1-5 ms. `gix-index` is chosen over the `--debug` subprocess for
large-monorepo format support (index v2/v3/v4 path compression, split, sparse),
which the unstable text output cannot promise. Index discovery resolves the
`.git`-file `gitdir:` indirection so a linked worktree reports against its own
index. Entries whose cached size is untrustworthy (racily-clean, recorded as 0)
are re-measured with one targeted `stat` each rather than dropped or flagged.
The `ignore` walker is retained as the fallback for a missing or corrupt index,
so behavior never regresses; untracked-file coverage moves off the launch path
to the daemon-side pass 2 (#551), consistent with the guard being a crude fast
nudge rather than a comprehensive audit.

## DD-023: The daemon spare-list is not deleted, even though clud never sets the marker itself

**Context:** zackees/clud#673 rev 3.0, recorded so it is not re-proposed.

An earlier draft of the reaper's burn fix concluded that
`find_declared_daemon_pids()` computes an always-empty set and should simply be
deleted. The reasoning was one command:
`grep -rn "RUNNING_PROCESS_IS_DAEMON" crates/` returns zero hits, therefore
nothing in this repository ever sets the marker, therefore the set is empty and
the per-exit full-host environment scan that computes it is pure waste.

That was wrong. The marker is set by **other programs**, not by clud.
`running_process::spawn::spawn_daemon_inner` applies it to every daemon-spawn
variant, and its own comment names the consumers: *"including the free functions
consumers like **zccache** call directly."*
`spawn_daemon_breaking_away_from_job` is documented for *"a build cache server,
a language server, anything discovered and reused by later, unrelated
invocations."* On a soldr/zccache machine the set is non-empty, and its members
are exactly the processes that must never be reaped. Shipping the deletion would
have made clud kill the user's build cache.

**Decision:** The daemon spare-list stays. Its *cost* is fixed by evaluating it
over the reaper's own Job Object membership instead of the host process table,
and by caching each identity's answer — not by removing the protection. The
marker is ranked **below** every OS-authoritative signal (job-object membership,
service session, session leader, token owner) precisely because opting in is
optional: sccache, dockerd and `FBuildWorker` never call it, so a design that
treated the marker as the only line of defence would leave them unprotected.
Listening-endpoint ownership covers that population. A name-based whitelist is
the last resort and must be data, not code.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- *Delete the spare-list.* Kills the user's build cache. This is the decision
  being recorded.
- *Keep the marker as the sole signal and just make it cheaper.* Leaves sccache,
  dockerd and `FBuildWorker` with no protection at all, which is the gap
  zackees/clud#674 exists to close.
- *Ship a built-in image-name allowlist.* Misfires on every unrelated build, and
  cannot be corrected by an operator without a release.

**Consequences:** The reaper spares more than it strictly must, which is the
correct direction — a false negative costs deferred cleanup, a false positive
destroys a user's warm cache. The transferable lesson is the reason this is a
recorded decision rather than a code comment: **a runtime set populated by other
programs cannot be characterized by grepping this repository.** The caveat is
stated where an agent will meet it, in
[`architecture/process-reaping.md`](architecture/process-reaping.md).

## DD-024: Reap decisions take injected process facts rather than calling Win32 inline

**Context:** zackees/clud#673 / #674. The reaper's spare-list needs signals only
the OS can answer — Job Object membership, terminal-services session id, POSIX
session leadership, token ownership, listening-endpoint ownership. The obvious
implementation calls those APIs at the point of decision. The obvious
implementation is also untestable: the decision would then require a real Job
Object, a real detached process and a real listening socket, so every case would
be a Windows-only integration test that spawns processes and races timing.

That is not a theoretical cost. The defect zackees/clud#674 exists to fix is a
*missing test* — no coverage asserted that a long-lived daemon started inside a
clud session survives it — and the reason none existed is that writing one
required exactly that machinery.

**Decision:** Every OS-authoritative signal sits behind a `ProcessFacts` trait.
Signals are collected once per reconcile pass into a `FactsSnapshot` and then
consulted as **pure data**; no code that decides reap-or-spare calls Win32. The
Win32 collection lives in one submodule of the listener. `FactsSnapshot` is both
the production carrier and the test fixture, so there is no second implementation
that could drift from the one under test. A signal the platform cannot answer is
recorded as *unavailable* and never spares.

The rule this encodes, stated as an architectural constraint rather than a style
preference: **prefer unit tests; an integration test is justified only when the
behaviour cannot be expressed against injected facts** — in practice only when a
real Job Object or real detachment is the thing under test.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- *Call the APIs inline and cover the behaviour with integration tests.* Windows
  exec lane only, seconds per case instead of microseconds, and it forces every
  future refinement into the slow lane. This is the status quo the decision
  replaces.
- *A `#[cfg(test)]` seam or a mock crate.* Two implementations means the tested
  one can drift from the shipped one; the snapshot is one type used by both.
- *Pass individual booleans into the planner.* Loses the precedence ordering,
  which is itself behaviour worth asserting, and makes adding a signal a
  signature change at every call site.

**Consequences:** The daemon decision table — zccache, soldr, sccache,
`FBuildWorker`, dockerd, language servers — is a table-driven unit test that runs
on every platform CI builds for, asserting the *reason* a process was spared and
not merely that it was. Integration coverage shrinks to what genuinely cannot be
faked, with a stated budget of ≤5 tests. The cost is one indirection on a path
that runs at most a few times per second, and the discipline that a new signal
must be added to the trait rather than called where it is needed.

## DD-025: The broker frame lane is the default daemon transport, superseding DD-006's TCP-only rationale

**Context:** [DD-006](#dd-006-cluddatardb-is-owned-exclusively-by-a-single-gc-daemon-process-clients-access-it-over-loopback-tcp)
chose loopback TCP for daemon IPC and explicitly rejected "named pipes / Unix
sockets directly" as platform-specific. `running-process` adoption later added a
broker v1 frame lane, and `send_daemon_request` now tries it **first** — which
means clud's default daemon transport is a named pipe on Windows and a Unix
socket everywhere else. The rejected mechanism became the primary one, and
nothing recorded the reversal.

That is not a documentation nicety. `docs/architecture/daemon-ipc.md` cited
DD-006 as the rationale for TCP *over* named pipes while the named pipe was
carrying the traffic, and an agent reading it as authoritative reached a wrong
conclusion about what the daemon could do (#692).

**Decision:** The broker frame lane (`daemon/rp_broker/`) is the default
transport for every `DaemonRequest`. Loopback TCP remains as the fallback and is
still authoritative in the sense that it always works: any miss —
`RUNNING_PROCESS_DISABLE=1`, a missing `daemon-identity.json` sidecar, a connect
or wire failure — falls through to it silently.

**Rationale:**
- DD-006's objection was *platform-specific code we would have to write*.
  `running-process` writes it, and clud consumes one `Endpoint` abstraction, so
  the cost the original decision was avoiding is no longer clud's to pay.
- The frame lane multiplexes many frames over one connection, which loopback TCP
  as wired here does not (one request per connection). That capability is a
  precondition for any future streaming or subscription surface.
- Keeping TCP as an always-available fallback means the reversal adds a fast
  path without adding a failure mode: no sidecar, no broker, no problem.

**Consequences:**
- "The loopback TCP listener" is no longer a complete description of daemon IPC.
  There are three listeners — frame lane, TCP, and the dashboard's HTTP port.
- Connection lifetime is a **client** policy, not a protocol limit. The daemon's
  `serve_connection` already loops; the client sends one request and drops the
  session. A caller wanting a long-lived channel does not need the daemon
  rewritten.
- DD-006's alternatives table is annotated rather than rewritten: the decision
  was correct when made, and the record of why it changed is more useful than a
  silent edit.
- See [daemon-ipc.md](architecture/daemon-ipc.md) for the lane table and the
  full eleven-variant request surface.

## DD-026: Model provider and executable harness are independent launch dimensions

**Context:** zackees/clud#625. The historical `Backend` enum simultaneously
meant model API, executable, command syntax, setup target, and persisted
default. That identity fails for Codex models driven through the Claude agent
harness and makes a future protocol bridge impossible to represent honestly.

**Decision:** Resolve `ModelProvider` and requested `HarnessSelection`
independently with CLI-over-global-over-built-in precedence. `default` maps to
the provider-native harness. One `ResolvedLaunchTarget` carries both effective
values and their `PreferenceSource`; unsupported Claude-through-Codex is an
error, never a fallback. The concrete `Backend` remains temporarily as the
effective executable compatibility type at existing bootstrap, setup, runner,
and daemon call sites.

Global changes are one locked settings-document patch. A shared generic choice
state machine serves provider, harness, and session/global selectors. New
`LaunchPlan` metadata is optional under serde so old daemon payloads fall back
to their legacy `backend`; repeat jobs pin their choices in argv.

**Consequences:** Existing invocations remain native and unchanged, while
`clud --codex --harness claude` is represented without lying about either
dimension. Later bridge phases can attach transport/auth behavior to the
resolved route rather than adding more backend booleans.

## DD-027: The Codex-to-Claude bridge is a launch-scoped bounded HTTP shell

**Context:** zackees/clud#626. A Codex model can be selected while the Claude
executable remains the effective harness, but that child expects an Anthropic
HTTP endpoint and bearer token. The compatibility route therefore needs a
local transport owner before later phases add request translation.

**Decision:** A single foreground runtime owns an authenticated bridge for the
whole launch and overlays only the spawned child's environment. The bridge
binds an ephemeral IPv4 loopback port, generates a per-launch 256-bit bearer
token, implements the minimal `/v1/messages` fixture surface, and shuts down
with the child on every return path. Native routes and dry-run do not start it.

The listener uses a small standard-library HTTP shell instead of `tiny_http`.
`tiny_http` starts connection parsing before application code receives a
request, so clud cannot enforce the required header-byte cap and header read
timeout at the transport boundary. The local shell keeps those controls, the
body cap, and the worker concurrency bound in one auditable layer.

**Consequences:** The bridge is intentionally not a daemon.

> **Partly superseded by [DD-029](#dd-029-the-bridge-always-streams-upstream-and-status-is-chosen-only-before-the-first-frame).**
> The paragraph below described phase 2, where the bridge did not yet translate
> or forward production traffic and answered from compiled fixtures. Since
> #627 step 5 it runs the real pipeline; the fixtures are gone. The transport
> and security decisions above still stand.

Its deterministic non-streaming and
SSE responses exist for compiled-fixture validation. Any debug upstream seam
is gated by both a debug build and `CLUD_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1`; release builds
ignore it. Logs and fixture reports expose only sanitized presence, port, and
status metadata, never the token or full authenticated URL.

## DD-028: The bridge times each I/O phase separately and streams responses chunked

**Context:** zackees/clud#627 phase 3 step 1. Phase 2's bridge carried one
`io_timeout` used as a whole-connection deadline, and a single `write_response`
that derives `Content-Length` from a fully materialised body. Both are correct
for a fixture server and wrong for model traffic: a real streamed completion
routinely outlives any deadline short enough to be a useful slowloris defence,
and a response whose length must be known up front cannot be delivered
progressively. The child is already configured for long turns —
`apply_cross_route_overlay` sets `API_TIMEOUT_MS` to 3 000 000.

**Decision:** Split the single budget into `header_timeout` (5 s),
`body_timeout` (30 s), and `stream_idle_timeout` (300 s). The first two are
absolute per-phase deadlines; the third is an *idle* timeout re-armed before
every frame, so total response duration is unbounded while a peer that stops
reading is still cut off. Add `write_event_stream` alongside `write_response`:
chunked transfer encoding, one chunk and one flush per SSE event. Errors and
non-streaming replies keep the original writer, which still owns the only path
that can choose a status code.

Reads are performed on blocking sockets with the per-read timeout capped at
`READ_POLL`, and a timeout is only fatal once the phase deadline has actually
passed. The cap exists so a worker parked on a quiet socket observes the
shutdown flag promptly; before this, a blocked read held teardown for its full
budget, because `shutdown()` on another thread does not reliably interrupt a
blocking `recv` on Windows.

**Consequences:** A body arriving in a different TCP segment from its headers
is now read correctly. It previously could not be: `TcpListener::set_nonblocking`
is inherited by accepted sockets on Windows, a non-blocking socket ignores
`SO_RCVTIMEO`, and the readers classified the resulting `WouldBlock` as a
timeout — so any request whose body did not arrive with its headers was
answered `408` immediately. Phase 2's tests never saw it because they write
headers and body in one call; every real Claude request carrying a transcript
or an image spans segments. Accepted sockets are now explicitly returned to
blocking mode, which also keeps the retry loop from busy-spinning.

Phase 3's translator replaces the fixture frames but inherits this framing
contract: one vector element per complete SSE event, flushed as produced.

**Amendment (#1263):** the *upstream* hop of the Anthropic passthrough proxy
did not follow the paragraph above. It reached for `ureq`'s
`Request::timeout(stream_idle_timeout)`, which ureq documents as covering
"reading the response body" and which *takes precedence over*
`AgentBuilder::timeout_read()` — so the budget was a whole-request deadline
wearing an idle timeout's name. Two things followed, both wrong in the same
direction: a stream that simply ran longer than 300 s (ordinary for a model
that thinks for minutes and keeps emitting deltas) was cut off mid-turn, and a
socket that had gone quiet was only noticed once that same absolute wall-clock
had elapsed. The hop now reads through an agent configured with
`timeout_connect` / `timeout_read` / `timeout_write`, which is the shape the
sibling `codex_upstream` hop has always used and the shape this entry claims.

Two limits are worth stating plainly, because neither is a bug to be fixed
later:

- **A committed stream terminates; it does not retry.** The status line is sent
  with the first frame (DD-029), so once a frame is on the wire a mid-stream
  failure has no status left to choose and no request left to replay — the
  transcript is half-delivered and replaying it would duplicate it. The only
  honest report is in-band, and the proxy now emits the same sanitized SSE
  `error` frame the translator does instead of writing the terminating chunk
  and closing, which was byte-identical to a stream that ended because the
  model finished.
- **Idle is measured on received bytes, never on turn duration.** A long think
  is healthy and a dead socket is not, and wall-clock alone cannot tell them
  apart. `stream_idle_timeout` is therefore correct at 300 s for this hop: a
  model may legitimately emit nothing for minutes *before its first token*,
  which is why the sibling hop keeps a separate `first_frame_timeout` for the
  pre-commit gate. Lowering the idle budget to catch a stall sooner would kill
  legitimate long turns first.

## DD-029: The bridge always streams upstream, and status is chosen only before the first frame

**Context:** zackees/clud#627 step 5 wired the translator, upstream client, and
SSE state machine into the bridge's `POST /v1/messages` handler, replacing the
phase-2 fixtures. Two shapes had to be served — Anthropic's streaming and
non-streaming replies — and failures can occur either before or after output
has started.

**Decision:** Send `stream: true` upstream unconditionally. A non-streaming
Messages request is answered by folding the translated Anthropic events back
into one `Message` with `MessageAggregator`. The alternative, a second
request/response mapping for the non-streaming shape, would double the surface
that has to stay correct while reusing none of the fuzzing that step 3 spent on
the streaming path.

Downstream status is chosen only while nothing has been written.
`EventStreamWriter` therefore defers its HTTP headers until the first frame:
before that a failure is a real status (`400` malformed, `422` unrepresentable,
`401` invalid local bearer, `502` unavailable/rejected upstream credentials,
`503` temporary refresh failure, other upstream `4xx` generally passed through,
`502`/`504` otherwise);
after it the response is committed and a failure is reported in-band as a
sanitized SSE `error` event, with the chunked body terminated cleanly. This is
the same boundary the upstream retry policy uses, and for the same reason.

**Consequences:** Aggregation is a pure function of the event stream, so the
non-streaming path inherits every property the streaming path proves. The
handler never has to decide whether it is "too late" to fail — it asks the
writer. Upstream bodies are never propagated in either direction, since they
carry account identifiers and key fragments.

The debug seam now points at a Responses-shaped fake rather than phase 2's
passthrough. That passthrough echoed the Anthropic body, so the end-to-end
tests could pass while translation was entirely wrong; the integration tests
now assert on the request the fake receives.

## DD-030: The bridge conforms to the live Codex clients, and translation is total

**Context:** zackees/clud#750. Phase 3 built the translator from the *shape* of
the Anthropic and OpenAI APIs. An audit against CLIProxyAPI (MIT) and
`openai/codex` (Apache-2.0) — the two implementations #622 names as references —
found it diverging from both in ways that break real traffic.

**Decision:** Match observable behaviour of the live clients, not a reading of
the API surface. Concretely:

- **Translation is total.** #627 made "unsupported semantics fail explicitly" an
  acceptance criterion; this reverses it. CLIProxyAPI's translator never errors,
  and Claude Code really does send `top_k`, `stop_sequences`, replayed
  `thinking` blocks and `role: "system"` messages. A 4xx the bridge invents is a
  failure the user cannot act on, so those inputs are dropped or adapted.
  `Invalid` — a request that is not a Messages request at all — is the only
  remaining error.
- **Sampling parameters are never forwarded.** Neither reference sends
  `temperature`, `top_p` or `max_output_tokens`, and reasoning models reject
  them.
- **`store: false` plus `include: ["reasoning.encrypted_content"]`** are sent
  unconditionally, as both references do. They are load-bearing together: with
  no server-side state, reasoning has to round-trip.
- **Reasoning round-trips.** An Anthropic `thinking` block's `signature` *is*
  the reasoning item's `encrypted_content`. Phase 3 dropped reasoning believing
  no signature was available; that premise was wrong. Foreign or malformed
  signatures are dropped rather than replayed, because replaying one is a hard
  upstream error.
- **System-prompt placement depends on auth mode.** `openai/codex` uses
  `instructions`; CLIProxyAPI uses a `developer` message because the Codex
  backend expects `instructions` to be Codex's *own* prompt. Modelled as
  `SystemPlacement` and selected from the resolved target.
- **Identifiers are bounded and reversible.** `call_id` and tool names are
  shortened to 64 characters with a hash suffix and a per-request reverse map,
  so MCP tool names survive the round trip with the names the client sent.

**Consequences:** The default model stays a single overridable value. Codex
fetches its catalogue from the server, so a hardcoded table would rot — and one
already would have: `gpt-5.4` retires from ChatGPT-auth Codex on 2026-08-31.

Validated against a real ChatGPT subscription: a streamed text turn and a
tool-use round trip both complete end to end. That validation surfaced a routing
defect no mock could: Claude Code sends `POST /v1/messages?beta=true`, and the
bridge matched the raw request target, so every real request 404'd. The mock
probe sends a bare path and had never exercised it.

**Amendment (#1220):** A usable Codex CLI login may be copied into clud's
separate credential store only after an interactive foreground bridge prompt.
The prompt is the explicit choice required by this decision; non-interactive,
daemon, expired, corrupt, and unreadable clud-record paths retain their prior
failure rather than switching credential sources. `never` records a refusal
and `always` records an opt-in under `codex.import_cli_login`; neither changes
the Codex CLI's files, and `clud auth logout codex` still removes only clud's
copy. The import prompt warns that the two stores are independent: a future
refresh may rotate the copied refresh token, so the Codex CLI can require its
own re-login. clud deliberately does not write another application's auth
file.

**Amendment (#1274):** Clud refreshes its selected subscription record on use
near expiry, with one guarded pre-output refresh/retry after an upstream 401.
After visible output, an in-band auth failure only marks the next turn for
credential recheck; it cannot replay the committed turn. A rejected refresh
grant may prompt an explicit same-account repair or account switch only in an
interactive foreground launch. Neither `always` nor another account silently
replaces the selected record. A downstream 401 remains reserved for a bad local
bridge bearer; upstream auth failures are gateway failures, not evidence that
Claude's local bearer is invalid.

## DD-031: Git-Bash completions are suppressed in the backend's login shell

**Context:** zackees/clud#753. On Windows every Claude Code `Bash` tool call was
costing ~4.4 s of CPU on an idle machine — ~20 s once the resulting process
storm saturated the box — before running any of the actual command.

The cause is a three-way collision, none of whose parts is wrong alone. Claude
Code builds a per-session "shell snapshot" by running the shell as a **login**
shell (`execFile(shell, ["-c", "-l", script])`) and replaying the captured
functions into every later tool call. Its capture filter,
`declare -F | cut -d' ' -f3 | grep -vE '^_[^_]'`, drops single-underscore
completion functions but *deliberately* keeps double-underscore helpers so
things like mise's `__zsh_like_cd` survive. On Windows, `-l` pulls in
`/etc/profile.d/git-prompt.sh`, which sources `git-completion.bash` — and Git's
completion internals are all `__git_*`, so ~84 of them pass the filter. Each is
serialised as ``eval "$(echo '<base64>' | base64 -d)"``: a subshell plus a real
`base64.exe`, i.e. **two process spawns per function, ~170 per tool call**,
under MSYS2's emulated `fork()`.

It is self-reinforcing rather than a fixed cost — more overhead means more
concurrent `bash.exe`, which means more contention, which means more overhead.
That is why the measured figure ranges from 4.4 s to ~20 s depending on load.

**Decision:** Export `WINELOADERNOEXEC=1` into the backend agent's environment
on Windows. Git for Windows guards both completion-sourcing blocks in
`/etc/profile.d/git-prompt.sh` with `test -z "$WINELOADERNOEXEC"`, so the login
shell skips `git-completion.bash` entirely. Measured: 85 captured functions → 1,
and 4,413 ms → 49 ms per tool call.

The policy lives in `shell::completion_guard::env_overrides()` and is applied by
**both** child-env builders — `runner::child_env` and
`daemon::io_helpers::child_env`. Those two are long-standing duplicates and the
daemon one had already drifted (it misses `CLUD_DISABLE_POWERSHELL` and the
Codex bridge overlay); wiring only the runner would have left daemon-launched
sessions paying the full tax. `CLUD_GIT_BASH_COMPLETIONS=1` opts back in.

**Why not the alternatives:**

- **`~/.config/git/git-prompt.sh`** — `git-prompt.sh:8` short-circuits the whole
  block if that file exists, which is cleaner and officially supported. But it
  is a *user-global* file that also changes the user's interactive shells. clud
  must not write it silently.
- **`CLAUDE_CODE_DONT_INHERIT_ENV`** — exists in the binary but only governs
  whether `process.env` is inherited. The functions come from `/etc/profile.d`,
  which a login shell reads regardless.
- **Fixing it in Claude Code** — the actual fix, and it is three lines: append
  `declare -f "$func"` straight to the snapshot instead of round-tripping
  through base64. Claude Code's own *zsh* branch already does exactly this
  (`typeset -f`); only the bash branch takes the detour. That costs zero spawns
  regardless of how many functions are captured, on every platform. Filed
  upstream; this DD covers the mitigation we control.

**Consequences:** This is a mitigation scoped to the worst-case platform. A
Linux or macOS user with a function-heavy `.bashrc` still pays the full
round-trip, because the lever is Git-for-Windows-specific.

`WINELOADERNOEXEC` is a variable Git for Windows *consults*, not one it
documents as an API, so a change on their side would silently stop suppressing
completions and the tax would quietly return. The guardrail is therefore
`tests/integration/cli/shell_completion_guard.rs`, which asserts the observed **function count**
of a real login shell rather than merely that the variable is set — an
env-var-presence assertion would keep passing through exactly the regression it
is meant to catch. The variable is deliberately not set off Windows, where Wine
may genuinely be running.

Side-effect surface was verified as a single line: diffing the full exported
environment of a login shell with and without it set shows only `PS1` losing its
`` `__git_ps1` `` segment, which is meaningless in a non-interactive tool-call
shell. PATH, every other exported variable, aliases and `git` itself are
identical.

## DD-032: The bridge classifies an upstream failure before deciding to retry it

**Decision:** `UpstreamClient` reads the error response — a bounded body prefix
plus `cf-ray`, `x-request-id` and `Retry-After` — reduces it to a classified
`UpstreamFailure`, and lets that class pick the retry budget. `502` is no longer
the catch-all downstream status for every non-gateway failure.

**Context:** The previous code discarded the response entirely
(`Err(ureq::Error::Status(status, _))`), keeping only the integer, and mapped
five unrelated failures — a real upstream 5xx, a transport reset, an oversized
response, a cancelled request, a downstream hangup — onto a single `502` whose
client message was the generic `"upstream provider error"`. An operator seeing a
502 could not tell a Cloudflare edge blip from a hard rejection from a bug in
clud itself, and neither could the retry loop.

That mattered because retrying is not always safe. Upstream returns *permanent*
rejections wearing a 5xx costume: a model that requires a newer client, an
unsupported parameter. Retrying those can never succeed, and CLIProxyAPI#4327
documents where it ends — one request fanning out to N upstream attempts, a
burst from a single exit IP tripping a Cloudflare 520, and healthy credentials
driven into cooldown. The old policy retried every `>= 500` identically, and its
total retry window was ~0.75s, which is simultaneously too eager for the
permanent class and far too short for the transient one.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- *Just raise `max_attempts`.* This is the change that produces the cascade
  above. Widening retry is only safe once the permanent class can be excluded,
  which is why classification is the load-bearing half and the budget increase
  rides behind it.
- *Retain the raw body on the error.* Rejected: upstream bodies can carry
  account identifiers and key fragments, and #630 makes not propagating them a
  hard rule. The body is read, classified, mined for a scrubbed one-line
  `detail`, and dropped. Only the class, the opaque ids and that scrubbed detail
  survive, and only the ids reach the client.
- *Fold `Unknown` into `Transient`.* Rejected for the same cascade reason.
  Folding it into `Permanent` was also rejected: it would break the first time
  upstream introduces a legitimately new transient code. A reduced budget is the
  safe middle, and it is the case that stays quiet when we guess wrong.
- *Classify on status alone.* Insufficient by construction — the whole problem
  is that the same status carries both classes. sub2api#4020 is the worked
  example: `gpt-5.6-sol` refused with a version-gate message inside a `502`.

**Consequences:** Classification is substring matching over a lowercased body,
so it is heuristic and will mis-file novel messages. The blast radius of a wrong
guess is bounded on purpose: a mis-filed permanent failure costs one extra
attempt (the `Unknown` budget), and a mis-filed transient one fails a request
that would likely have failed anyway. The signature lists are the thing to
extend when a new shape shows up, not the control flow.

The no-replay-after-first-byte invariant (DD-029) is untouched and still tested;
every change here is confined to the pre-commit window, which is the only place
a `502` could ever have been chosen.

`499` is not an RFC status. It is the conventional code for "client closed
request" and unambiguous in a log, and by the time it is selected there is
normally no reader left to receive it.

The expired-login guardrail reads a JWT `exp` claim **without verifying the
signature** — clud has no key, and verification is the issuer's job. It exists
only to avoid starting a turn on a token that is already dead, so a bearer that
is not a JWT, or carries no `exp`, is deliberately treated as live: opaque
tokens are legitimate. Actual refresh remains #629's scope.
---

## DD-033: Plan mode and subagents are constrained on the Codex-to-Claude bridge

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** On `clud --codex --harness claude`, users reported the agent
entering plan mode with no prompting — an ordinary question ("can we always
enable that debug log?") turning into an unrequested planning session with
three exploration subagents.

This is not a clud defect and not a bridge translation bug. Plan mode has two
entry paths in the Claude harness: the user toggles it (shift+tab), or **the
model enters it itself** by calling the harness-provided `EnterPlanMode` tool.
That tool's own description instructs the model to use it *proactively* for
non-trivial implementation asks, listing new features, multiple valid
approaches, architectural decisions, multi-file changes and unclear
requirements as triggers. A feature-shaped question hits several at once, so
the model volunteers a plan. `--dangerously-skip-permissions` does not cover
this; only `--disallowedTools` removes the tool.

clud already stripped `EnterPlanMode,AskUserQuestion`, but only when
`is_unattended` (a `clud loop`, or explicit `--unattended`). The reported
sessions were **interactive**, so the flag was never emitted.

**Decision:** Disallow `EnterPlanMode` on every launch where the model provider
is Codex and the effective harness is Claude, independent of `--unattended`.
Also disallow Claude Code's `Task` tool on that bridge: the Task tool creates
background Claude agents, each with an independent provider request, so it can
turn one requested harness run into unbounded subscription spend. `--allow-plan-mode`
opts back into planning only; it never restores `Task`. When plan suppression
applies, clud prints a green, stderr, TTY-only notice naming the override, so
the behavior is never silent.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **Extend the rule to all Claude-harness launches.** Simplest diff — delete
  `is_unattended &&`. Rejected: on a plain `clud`, plan mode is a feature users
  deliberately reach for, and a global kill would take shift+tab away from
  people who never asked. The complaint is specific to the bridge, where a
  Codex model is driving Claude-harness tooling it was not tuned against.
- **Suppress `AskUserQuestion` too, matching the unattended token.** Rejected:
  multiple-choice questions are useful interactively and were not part of the
  complaint. The unattended rule keeps stripping both, because a run with no
  human attached stalls on either one; the bridge rule is narrower on purpose.
- **A silent suppression.** Rejected: removing a harness capability without
  saying so produces the mirror-image confusion — "why can I not plan?" The
  notice costs one line and carries the override.

**Consequences:** The two rules now compose into one `--disallowedTools` token
rather than a fixed string, and `--allow-plan-mode` deliberately does **not**
re-enable plan mode for `--unattended` / `clud loop` runs on the bridge; the
older stall-avoidance reason still applies there and is asserted by
`test_allow_plan_mode_does_not_re_enable_it_for_unattended_runs`.

The token stays `=`-bound and comma-separated for the reason in DD-002's
neighborhood and `builder.rs`: `claude` declares `--disallowedTools` as
variadic, so a space-separated spelling swallows a following `-p <prompt>` and
claude exits 0 with no output and no diagnostic.

## DD-034: The bridge's default model is the cheap tier, not the flagship

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** zackees/clud#776. `DEFAULT_CODEX_MODEL` was `gpt-5.6-sol`, the
flagship of the gpt-5.6 family, and nothing could override it at runtime:
`resolve_model` (`codex_translate.rs`) only forwards a request's own model when
the id does *not* start with `claude`, and the Claude harness always sends
`claude-*`, so every bridged request fell through to the constant. The two
override seams that exist — `UpstreamTarget::with_model_override` and
`Pipeline::with_default_model` — had no production callers.

The family is three tiers at one context size (1,050,000 tokens), differing
only in price and default effort:

| id | tier | $/1M in | $/1M out | catalog default effort |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt-5.6-sol` | flagship | $5 | $30 | `low` |
| `gpt-5.6-terra` | mid | $2 | $12 | `medium` |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | fast/cheap | $0.2 | $1.2 | `medium` |

A default nobody selected was billing at 2.5x the mid tier on both input and
output, and it drained a real credit account before anyone noticed — the more
so because the resulting out-of-credits 429 was itself swallowed (#774).

**Decision:** `DEFAULT_CODEX_MODEL` is `gpt-5.6-terra`. Effort is unchanged:
`reasoning_for` already emits `medium` when the request carries no `thinking`
block, and `medium` is terra's own catalog default — so the cheap tier is also
the correctly-configured one, and "terra at medium" needs no effort change.

The default is asserted on the **wire**, not against the constant
(`codex_pipeline.rs::the_billed_default_is_terra_at_medium`). A test written as
`assert_eq!(sent["model"], DEFAULT_CODEX_MODEL)` follows the constant wherever
it goes and by construction cannot notice a change in what the user is charged;
three such assertions existed and all three stayed green across the flip.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **`luna`.** 10x cheaper again, but it is the fast tier and wrong for a main
  coding loop. It belongs in the alias table as an explicit opt-in.
- **Keep `sol` and add an override first.** Rejected on sequencing, not merit:
  the override work (#752) carries an open question about whether Claude Code
  offers effort controls for a non-`claude` model id, and the cost bleed should
  not wait on it. The flip is one string; the selection feature lands after.
- **Read the model from an env var here.** Rejected as scope: an escape hatch
  needs a settings-persistence story (`GlobalLaunchPreferences`) to be worth
  having, which is #752's territory.

**Consequences:** `codex_upstream.rs`'s version-gate regression fixture still
names `gpt-5.6-sol` deliberately — it asserts against a real upstream error
message that happens to mention that id, and renaming it would weaken the
regression it guards.

**Amendment (2026-09-21, #1254):** The reviewed direct Codex default is now
`gpt-5.6-sol` at its catalog-native `low` effort. Model/effort selection,
source provenance, cache-health protection, and live usage visibility landed
after #776, so the prior unobservable hardcoded-Sol failure mode no longer
describes the launch path. The catalog remains the single authority and feeds
both native Codex and Codex-through-Claude; explicit CLI and saved provider
profiles still win, unified mode remains harness-owned, and the Claude
overlay's separate Opus-to-Sol / Sonnet-to-Terra delegation aliases are
unchanged. Wire-level fake-upstream tests pin both the billed model and effort
so this policy cannot drift silently.

## DD-035: Codex model and effort travel in the model string, not beside it

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** zackees/clud#752. DD-034 made the default cheap; this is how a
user picks something else. The Claude harness talks to the bridge over the
Anthropic Messages API, which has no field for "which Codex model" or "at what
effort". Two channels could carry that intent, and they are not equally
reliable:

- **`output_config.effort`** — where `/effort`, `--effort`,
  `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` and the `/model` effort slider land. The harness
  only sends it when it decides the model *supports* effort, which it decides
  by matching the model id against known families. A raw `gpt-5.6-*` id matches
  nothing.
- **The model id itself** — never validated, never rewritten, never dropped
  behind a custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, because the gateway is declared to own
  the model namespace. Whatever the user types in `/model` arrives verbatim.

The bridge modelled neither. `MessagesRequest` had no `output_config` field
and unknown fields are deliberately tolerated, so the user's effort choice was
**dropped without a trace**: every request ran at the ladder's `medium`
regardless of what was selected. `/effort xhigh` was a silent no-op.

**Decision:** Selection is spelled `<model>[@<effort>]` in the model string —
`terra`, `sol@max`, `gpt-5.6-luna@low` — parsed by `codex_model.rs`.
`output_config.effort` is *also* read now, as a secondary channel.

Precedence, most explicit first: `@effort` suffix → `output_config.effort` →
the `thinking` budget ladder → the model's own catalog default.

Three supporting rules:

- **An unknown short name is a 400 that names the valid ones; an unknown full
  id passes through.** `/model tera` is a typo, and forwarding it would either
  earn a confusing upstream error or — worse — silently bill a model nobody
  chose. But `gpt-5.7-whatever` is how a user reaches a model released after
  this table was written. The split is punctuation: a bare word must be in the
  table, anything containing `-` or `.` is a full id.
- **"No effort specified" is not `medium`.** Each model has its own catalog
  default (`sol` = `low`, `terra`/`luna` = `medium`), and the harness sends
  `thinking: {"type":"adaptive"}` with *no* budget for ids it does not
  recognize — which is every id the bridge serves. Reading a missing budget as
  an explicit `medium` pinned every request to `medium`.
- **The ladder no longer emits `minimal` and can now reach `max`.** `minimal`
  is a real Responses value that **no gpt-5.6 model accepts** (the family
  starts at `low`), so every small-budget request was being rejected upstream
  for a reason the user could not see. `max` is supported by all three and was
  unreachable from any budget. Re-confirmed against OpenAI's model guidance
  for #821: gpt-5.6 accepts `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`.
- **A stated-but-unsupported `output_config.effort` is a 400, not a
  fallthrough (#821).** It originally deferred to the next channel, on the
  theory that the harness's own field should never fail a turn the user is
  waiting on. But the channel below it is the model's *default*, so the turn
  ran at an effort the user never chose and could not observe — `/effort
  minimal` silently became terra's `medium`. Since `minimal` is a genuine
  Responses value, it is exactly the spelling a user would expect to work,
  which makes the silence worst here. Both effort channels now produce the
  same actionable message naming the accepted values. An *absent* or empty
  effort still defers: that is the harness declining to send the field, not a
  user naming a value.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **`output_config` alone.** The obvious reading of the problem ("model the
  field you forgot"), and insufficient: it depends on the harness's capability
  matching offering the control for a non-`claude` id at all, which is exactly
  the thing we cannot rely on. It is kept as the secondary channel because
  users who *do* get the native control should have it work.
- **Gateway model discovery (`GET /v1/models`) to populate the picker.**
  Blocked three ways: the bridge does not serve the route, clud forces
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1` (discovery does not run when
  nonessential traffic is off), and discovery *ignores every id not prefixed
  `claude`/`anthropic`* — i.e. every id we would advertise. Making that work
  needs synthetic `claude-codex-*` ids mapped back through the alias table, and
  it would invert `resolve_selection`'s `claude*` rule. Deferred;
  `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` (documented to skip validation) gives one
  honest picker row today for a fraction of the work.
- **Patching the harness binary** to bake in aliases, as `@bman654/clodex`
  does. It confirms the constraint is real, but an unmaintainable coupling to
  someone else's build.
- **Tier hijacking** (`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` → a Codex id), which most
  of the proxy ecosystem does. Cheap, but it lies about which model is running
  and burns the `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku` names.

**Consequences:** `--model` on the bridge is expanded to the wire id in argv
and recorded on `LaunchPlan::codex_model`, so `--dry-run` shows what will be
billed rather than the shorthand that was typed, and every launch path —
subprocess, PTY, daemon, detach, repeat — hands the bridge the same value. A
selection that does not parse fails the *launch* rather than the first turn.

The two previously-dead override seams (`UpstreamTarget::with_model_override`,
`Pipeline::with_default_model`) now have production callers and carry a
`ModelSpec` rather than a `String`, so a model and its effort cannot drift
apart in transit.

## DD-036: The bridge propagates the classification, not the status

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** zackees/clud#774. A real out-of-credits condition reached the user
as `upstream provider returned status 429` — naming no cause, no account, no
reset, and no remedy. The session then retried into the wall and went quiet;
the account was discovered to be empty hours later, from a different tool's
output.

Upstream had told us everything needed. #764 fixed the first half by capturing
the failure instead of binding the response to `_`, so `UpstreamFailure`
already carried the status, `Retry-After`, `resets_in_seconds`, `cf-ray` and
`x-request-id`. What remained was that **every consumer downstream of that
capture re-derived its answer from the status code**, which had already lost
the distinction the classifier computed:

- `anthropic_error_type(status)` mapped `429 -> rate_limit_error`, so
  `billing_error` could not reach the client on the non-streaming path.
- `complete()` replaced any in-band failure with
  `Transport("upstream stream failed")` — a semantic quota failure became a
  transport failure, became a `502 api_error`.
- `StreamTranslator::fail` received the full upstream error object and used it
  only to pick one of four type constants, hardcoding the message to
  `"upstream provider error"`. The provider's own wording was not redacted; it
  was never read.
- The streaming path returned HTTP 200 for a failure delivered inside a 200
  SSE stream, with **no log line even under `CLUD_CODEX_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1`**.
- `stream_json::render_line` dropped `{"type":"error"}` through its catch-all,
  so the entire user-visible trace of a failed turn was `[claude] error`.

**Decision:** The classification travels; the status is derived from it, never
the reverse.

- `FailureClass::Exhausted` splits out of `Permanent`. It is checked **before**
  the "408/429 are transient" rule, because the ChatGPT backend reports plan
  exhaustion as a 429 and status alone cannot distinguish it from a throttle.
  It earns exactly one attempt: a multi-day exhaustion previously burned three
  attempts in ~750 ms.
- `PipelineError::Provider` carries an in-band failure with its classified
  kind, so a quota failure inside a 200 keeps its identity instead of being
  relabelled transport.
- `error_type_for` consults `failure_class()` first, so `billing_error` reaches
  the client on both paths.
- The bridge emits `Retry-After` (its first response header beyond the fixed
  four) and gained the missing `429 Too Many Requests` reason phrase.
- Durations are rendered as a clock — `5d 2h`, not `442242s`.
- A terminal account failure prints one ungated, belled `[clud]` stderr line
  per process, following `wedge_watchdog`'s warn-once-per-episode precedent.
  Every other bridge diagnostic is either debug-gated or in a forensic log
  nothing reads back, and a drained account is not a debugging detail.

**The secrecy invariant is unchanged (#630).** No upstream byte reaches the
client. The bug was never that the body was redacted — it was that the body was
*deleted unread*, so no failure could be reported as what it was. Every
client-facing string here is one we wrote, selected by a classification derived
from the body and then discarded.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **Widen `UpstreamError::Status(u16)` to carry the body.** Would put an
  upstream-controlled string one careless `format!` away from the client.
  Typed, non-secret fields make the leak impossible rather than unlikely.
- **Echo the provider's `message`.** It is the only place the words "out of
  credits" appear upstream, and it is also where account identifiers and key
  fragments appear. Synthesizing from the classification gets the same
  information across with none of the risk.
- **Treat every 429 as non-retryable.** Simpler, and wrong: an ordinary
  throttle is exactly the case retry-with-backoff exists for. The body is what
  separates them.

## DD-037: Embed the Codex-via-Claude bridge and make credentials explicit

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The supported cross-route must translate an Anthropic-compatible
local harness request to the OpenAI Responses API without making installation,
runtime ownership, or a credential fallback ambiguous. A Go/Node proxy or
downloaded sidecar would add an executable, updater, separate crash surface,
and target-runner runtime dependency to a feature that ships inside clud's
existing Rust artifact.

**Decision:** The bridge is an in-process Rust subsystem, bound per launch to
an authenticated ephemeral loopback address and owned by `ForegroundRuntime`.
It performs the protocol translation itself and downloads no external runtime.
Credentials are an explicit choice: a clud-owned subscription record wins when
present; only its absence permits `OPENAI_API_KEY`; expiry/error never silently
changes source. The bridge's environment overlay is child-local and native
launches do not enter this path.

**Consequences:** Release artifacts remain self-contained and the lifetime is
one owner/one shutdown path. The stricter credential rule can require a user to
log in again instead of continuing with a usable API key, but it prevents a
surprising billing/authentication source change. Rollback remains a single
`--harness default` launch or settings reset.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **Go/Node/npm sidecar or downloaded proxy:** adds a runtime and packaging
  matrix the shipped artifact cannot guarantee.
- **A shared daemon-owned bridge:** makes listener/bearer lifetime cross
  sessions and obscures shutdown/credential ownership.
- **Fallback from an expired subscription to an API key:** may silently change
  account, billing, and policy for the same user action.
- **Fail the turn on an in-band failure inside a committed 200.** DD-029's
  no-status-after-first-byte invariant stands. The status cannot change, so the
  fix is to make the failure *visible* — log, banner, and a named SSE error
  frame — not to pretend the status is still choosable.

## DD-038: The Codex picker gets one honest row, always, carrying the catalog

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** zackees/clud#820 asked for Sol, Terra, and Luna as three
independently selectable entries in Claude Code's `/model` picker. DD-035 had
already delivered `<alias>@<effort>` selection and a *single*
`ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` row, explicitly deferring the full list.

The premise was checked against Claude Code 2.1.212's own picker builder rather
than assumed. Six sources contribute rows, and none yields three honest Codex
entries:

1. **The built-in Anthropic lineup**, renameable via
   `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_{OPUS,SONNET,HAIKU,FABLE}_MODEL` — the tier hijacking
   DD-035 rejected, because it burns the Anthropic names and lies about what
   is running.
2. **`ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION`** — read once, as a scalar, and pushed as
   one `{value, label, description}`. The binary contains exactly four names
   in this family (`…_OPTION`, `…_OPTION_NAME`, `…_OPTION_DESCRIPTION`,
   `…_OPTION_SUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES`), all scalars. There is no indexed,
   repeated, or delimited form, so it cannot be made to emit a second row.
3. **Gateway discovery (`GET /v1/models`)** — needs an opt-in
   `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY`, is skipped while
   non-essential traffic is disabled (clud forces that off), and filters the
   response with `/^(claude|anthropic)/i`, dropping every id the bridge
   serves. Ruled out by #820 and by DD-035.
4. **`additionalModelOptionsCache`** in the user's global config — a cache of
   Anthropic's own server response, refreshed behind our back. Not an
   extension point.
5. **The `availableModels` settings allowlist** — an allowlist, and it only
   ever *adds* ids matching `anthropic.…` or `claude-…`; `gpt-5.6-*` is
   skipped.
6. **The currently selected model**, which is a row because it is selected —
   not a way to advertise one that is not.

**Decision:** One row is the honest ceiling, so make that row do all the work.
`codex_model::picker_entry` owns the row and is rendered from `CODEX_MODELS`
and `Effort::ALL`, so it can never advertise a model or an effort
`ModelSpec::parse` would then reject. Two behaviours follow:

- **The description carries the catalog.** It names every alias, wire id, and
  per-model default effort, plus the effort ladder — because there is no
  second row to put them in, and `/model <id>` accepts any string once a
  custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` owns the namespace, so naming them is enough to
  make them reachable.
- **The row is unconditional.** It previously appeared only with an explicit
  `--model`; an unpinned `clud --codex` therefore showed a picker of
  Anthropic names, *all* of which quietly ran on `gpt-5.6-terra`. The row now
  always exists and spells the model that will actually be billed.

**Consequences:** The picker is honest in the default case for the first time,
and the two models a user did not launch with are discoverable from inside the
picker instead of only from `--help`. `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION` only adds
a row — it does not change the active model — so an unpinned launch still
resolves `claude*` ids to the bridge default exactly as before. A user who
exports any of the three variables keeps their own value (`push_default`).

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **Three rows via any of the six sources above** — impossible without either
  misrepresenting Codex models as Anthropic ones or turning on the discovery
  path #820 forbids.
- **Writing `additionalModelOptionsCache` into `~/.claude.json`.** It would
  render three rows, and it is a cache the harness owns and overwrites; a
  clud that edits it is a clud that breaks on the next refresh.
- **Declaring `ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION_SUPPORTED_CAPABILITIES`**
  (`effort`, `xhigh_effort`, `max_effort` are real capability tokens) to light
  up the native effort control for the Codex row. Tempting and out of scope
  here: it changes which `output_config.effort` values the harness sends, and
  DD-035 made a stated-but-unsupported effort a 400. It needs its own issue
  and its own upstream check, not a rider on a picker-presentation change.

## DD-039: Bundled skills have exactly one source of truth

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** clud shipped **two** bundled-skill registries, each with its own
installer, both writing `~/.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`:

| | Registry A | Registry B (retired) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Constant | `BUNDLED_SKILLS` in `src/skills.rs` | `BUNDLED_SKILLS` in `src/skill_install.rs` |
| Source tree | `crates/clud-bin/assets/skills/` (18) | **mixed** — 7 from `assets/skills/`, 5 from root `skills/` (12) |
| Launch action | `BundledSkillsAction` (ran 1st) | `ClaudeDriftSkillsAction` (ran 2nd) |
| Backends | Claude **and** Codex | Claude only |

Both ran as Global-scope actions in the same startup sequence, so A wrote and
B overwrote. Each installer compared the file on disk against *its own*
embedded copy, classified the other's output as drift, and rewrote it. Every
launch printed `updated /clud-pr` and `updated /clud-issue`.

Neither installer was wrong in isolation. Both were internally consistent and
individually correct — nothing enforced that the two registries owned disjoint
names. That is precisely why the bug survived review and CI: there was no
single artifact anyone could look at and see the conflict.

Three consequences, of which the log noise was the least important:

1. **Stale content silently won.** B ran last, so root copies landed on disk.
   `assets/skills/clud-pr/SKILL.md` (updated 2026-08-03) was overwritten every
   launch by a root copy last touched 2026-06-18. The commit
   `fix(skills): refresh stale bundled skills and retire dead ones (#756)`
   never reached a single user.
2. **Codex and Claude diverged.** A installed to both `~/.claude` and
   `~/.codex`; B only overwrote `~/.claude`. Same skill, two backends,
   different bodies.
3. **`updated` became meaningless.** Firing unconditionally every launch made
   a genuine drift repair — the message's actual purpose — indistinguishable
   from noise.

**Decision:** Bundled skills have exactly one source of truth:
`crates/clud-bin/assets/skills/`, installed by `src/skills.rs`. The root
`skills/` tree and `src/skill_install.rs` are deleted.

`skills.rs` survives because it is strictly more capable: 18 skills vs 12,
multi-backend vs Claude-only, an explicit retirement mechanism
(`PURGED_BUNDLED_SKILLS`) that sweeps every backend, and it was already the
registry CLAUDE.md documented.

Enforcement is `ci/banned_skill_sources.py`, run by `bash lint`:

1. Skill bodies may only be `include_str!`'d from `assets/skills/`.
2. Only `skills.rs` / `skills_home.rs` may build a backend skills path.
3. No second skill source tree at the repo root.

Rule 1 alone would have caught the original bug.

**Alternatives considered:**

- **Keep both, add a disjointness test.** Rejected: it legitimizes two
  installers and only catches *name* collisions, not the divergent bodies that
  caused the visible damage. The duplication is the defect, not a symptom.
- **A dylint.** Rejected on two grounds. Practically, dylint is Linux-only
  nightly and **skipped on PRs**, so drift would merge and be reported hours
  later on `main`. Substantively, these are not Rust-semantic questions —
  "which directory does this path literal point at" and "does a directory
  exist at the repo root" are text and filesystem facts, and the latter no
  Rust lint can answer at all. A compile-free scan is the right tool, matching
  `banned_imports.py` and `banned_cross_tools.py`.
- **Rust unit tests asserting registry/dir agreement.** Dropped as not
  load-bearing once rule 1 exists. Can be added later if wanted.

**Consequences:** `clud-pr-merge` lived only in registry B with no `assets/`
copy, so it had to be migrated *before* B could be deleted — done as a
separate additive PR (#848) so the deletion was provably safe rather than
trusted. Codex gained `clud-pr-merge`, which it never received. Users on
`clud-pr` / `clud-issue` move to the newer `assets/` bodies, which is the
content that was always intended to ship.

The root copies did carry sections the assets copies lack, and those were
checked rather than assumed: `clud-pr`'s *Meta Tracking Issue Mode* is
superseded by `clud-fix`'s Meta/Parent/Burn-Down workflow, and `clud-issue`'s
*What counts as a blocking question* was deliberately replaced by "resolve the
open questions yourself / **Open questions**". Both are superseded, not
missing, so nothing was ported. *(Amended by [DD-040](#dd-040-clud-pr-clud-fix-clud-do-and-clud-pr-merge-are-retired-in-favor-of-goal): the
`clud-issue` decision-discipline content was subsequently judged complementary
rather than superseded, and ported into the assets copy.)*

---

## DD-040: clud-pr, clud-fix, clud-do and clud-pr-merge are retired in favor of /goal

**Status:** Accepted. Builds on [DD-039](#dd-039-bundled-skills-have-exactly-one-source-of-truth); partially reverses #848 (which migrated `clud-pr-merge` into `skills.rs` to preserve it).

**Context:** zackees/clud#844. With DD-039's consolidation landed, the
question remained what to do with the four orchestration skills. Their core
loop — lock a deliverable in, drive to it, refuse to stop early — is what the
harness's `/goal` Stop-hook command does natively. Keeping them meant
maintaining three long playbooks (plus `clud-pr-merge` as a fourth) that
re-implement a built-in, and the two largest (`clud-pr`, `clud-fix`) were the
most cross-referenced skills in the tree.

**Decision:**

- `clud-pr`, `clud-fix`, `clud-do` and `clud-pr-merge` are deleted from
  `assets/skills/` and added to `PURGED_BUNDLED_SKILLS`, which sweeps **every**
  backend's skills dir on next launch (the deleted `PURGED_SKILLS` only ever
  swept `~/.claude`). A user-owned copy (marker stripped) is preserved.
- Surviving skills route orchestration to `/goal`, the worktree/process-audit
  playbook to `clud-git` (which inherits the Windows teardown guardrail test),
  and review delegation to `clud-review`.
- The root-fork `clud-issue` content that DD-039 classed as superseded was
  re-audited and found **complementary**, not superseded — the question
  budget, `## Decisions` issue-body section, blocking-question taxonomy,
  face-value reading, and `--repo` flags are ported into the assets copy.
- `install_to` compares modulo whitespace (`normalize()`, ported from the
  deleted module) so an LF-vs-CRLF difference is not a change, and
  `BundledSkillsAction` announces `[clud] updated /<name>` only for entries in
  the report's `refreshed` list. A current install performs no write at all;
  `real_bundle_install_is_idempotent` and `line_ending_drift_is_not_a_refresh`
  pin both properties.

**Consequences:**

- **A capability is lost, not migrated:** PR Drive Mode (driving an open PR
  through CI failures, review comments and merge conflicts to merge) has no
  `/goal` equivalent. Restoring it means writing a new skill, not reverting
  this change.
- **A whitespace-only edit to a bundled `SKILL.md` no longer propagates** to
  installed homes — the deliberate price of not re-creating #844 on CRLF
  checkouts.
- The four names may be re-introduced later; doing so means removing them from
  `PURGED_BUNDLED_SKILLS` in the same commit that re-adds the bundle entries
  (`retired_skills_are_not_also_bundled` enforces the disjointness).

## DD-041: Unified routing is a mode, and model identity has one provider-neutral registry

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Issues #898-#901 add a Claude-harness session that can route to
Claude, Codex, and DeepSeek. Before that gateway, clud exposed provider flags,
an independent harness choice, a Codex-only model parser, DeepSeek constants in
the foreground runtime, and a `LaunchMode` type that already meant subprocess
versus PTY. Treating unified as another provider or adding another catalog
would conflate identity and freeze incompatible public state.

**Decision:** `RoutingMode::{Direct, Unified}` is independent from
`ModelProvider::{Claude, Codex, DeepSeek}`, `HarnessSelection`, and the existing
process `LaunchMode`. `provider_catalog.rs` is the single authority mapping
stable clud CLI/settings IDs, gateway discovery IDs, provider wire IDs,
compatibility aliases, and effort/context capabilities. Compound legacy inputs
normalize into separate typed fields before bootstrap. `LaunchPlan` carries the
normalized selection additively with source metadata and no credentials.

The compatibility grammar remains first-class: bare `clud`, permanent provider
flags, provider-before-action composition, and unknown harness passthrough all
remain supported. `run`, `--provider`, `--effort`, and `--context-window` are
owned by clud before `--` and can still be passed literally after it. Unknown
future provider wire IDs remain reachable and are stored byte-for-byte beside
their typed provider identity.

**Consequences:** Direct launches and the unified gateway cannot drift into
different model maps. A provider/model conflict or conflicting legacy/explicit
modifier fails before credentials or paid requests. Repeats pin the normalized
selection instead of re-reading settings. During the dependency-ordered #901
burn-down, unified grammar and wire state may land before the gateway; until
the gateway is enabled, a non-dry unified launch fails locally rather than
silently acting like direct Claude.

---

## DD-042: Unified effort is the harness-resolved session value

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Issue #899. Claude Code sends the final effective effort in
`output_config.effort`, after resolving `/effort`, `--effort`, settings,
environment, picker controls, and request-specific overrides. The wire request
does not identify the winning source and `/effort auto` has already been
resolved. Claude, Codex, and DeepSeek expose different defaults and capability
ladders, so a gateway cannot both honor the final value and silently restore a
provider default after `/model` changes.

**Decision:** Unified mode treats effort as one harness-owned session value and
routes each request independently. It does not inject DeepSeek direct mode's
global max overlay and does not remove an ambient
`CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`. Native Claude receives the original Messages body.
Codex discovery IDs resolve before the legacy `claude*` fallback and reuse the
existing strict precedence (`@effort`, `output_config`, stated thinking budget,
catalog default). DeepSeek receives the Anthropic effort field unchanged and
owns its documented five-name-to-two-effective-level mapping.

Provider switching also starts a new conversation route epoch. Crossing away
from Codex discards its opaque canonical Responses state; returning to Codex
reseeds from the complete Anthropic-visible transcript instead of appending to
stale provider-private history. Session and subagent identities remain
independent.

**Consequences:** The same effort label can have different latency/cost effects
on different models. Unified mode does not promise to restore Sol `low`,
Terra/Luna `medium`, or a provider's catalog default after a switch because
that source information no longer exists at the gateway. Unsupported Codex
values fail before an upstream call, while DeepSeek-compatible or future values
are not rejected by Codex policy. Direct Claude, Codex, and Codex-via-Claude
launch profiles are unchanged; the direct DeepSeek profile later dropped its
max-effort pin — see [DD-059](#dd-059-direct-provider-launches-carry-effort-on-the-session-flag-and-the-reviewed-default-is-low).

---

## DD-043: Unified launch guards, token counting, and optional-provider notices

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Issue #898 left three open edges on the merged unified gateway.
Claude Code discovery silently discards synthetic IDs on clients older than
2.1.223, so a stale install presents the old picker instead of failing. The
gateway had no answer for `POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` in unified mode.
And a launch with missing optional credentials showed fewer picker rows with
no explanation of how to restore them.

**Decision:**

- **Version floor at launch.** Before the child or gateway starts, a non-dry
  unified launch probes the bootstrapped client's `--version`. Outputs older
  than 2.1.223 fail with the installed version and the `claude update` remedy.
  Dry runs skip the probe entirely.
- **Token counting has one Anthropic-compatible contract.** Ordinary Claude
  model IDs proxy to the Anthropic endpoint; synthetic Codex and DeepSeek
  routes return an explicit local 404 so Claude Code falls back to its
  documented local estimation. Unknown reserved IDs still fail locally before
  any upstream request.
- **One sanitized startup notice per missing optional provider.** The
  foreground runtime prints a single actionable line naming the remedy
  (`clud auth login codex` / `clud auth login deepseek`) instead of a silent
  short catalog. Notices never contain secret material, and a missing optional
  credential still never blocks native Claude.
- **Initial selections resolve to discovery IDs.** A launch-time
  `--model`/settings selection for Codex or DeepSeek is emitted to the child
  as the catalog discovery ID, not the provider wire ID: an unrecognized
  `gpt-*`/`deepseek-*` ID would otherwise read as an ordinary Claude ID and be
  proxied to Anthropic.
- **The gateway also resolves persisted wire IDs.** A continued or resumed
  session can still carry a provider wire ID or CLI alias past discovery. The
  gateway resolves every model through the shared catalog before falling
  through to native Claude, so known `gpt-*`/`deepseek-*` IDs route to their
  own provider (and count_tokens answers 404 for them) instead of leaking to
  Anthropic.

**Consequences:** A stale Claude Code install cannot silently show a degraded
picker, and a partial credential setup explains itself at launch. Token
counting either reaches a provider that speaks the contract or falls back to
harness-local estimation; clud never fabricates a count for a synthetic route.
Deprecated `codex-auth`/`deepseek-auth` aliases also print their exact
replacement spelling, including preserved flags, instead of a bare command
name.

## DD-044: Installed harness selection is transient launcher history

**Context:** DeepSeek AI publishes a separate developer-preview harness whose
binary and command grammar (`dsh web`, or `dsh --profile headless <prompt>`)
are distinct from clud's existing DeepSeek-provider-through-Claude route.
Meanwhile, a bare launch had no fast way to choose among multiple installed
agent harnesses without turning a remembered UI choice into routing policy.

**Decision:** Model provider and executable harness identity remain separate.
`--deepseek` retains its existing provider meaning, while
`--harness deepseek` selects `dsh`. Bare interactive launches discover
Claude, Codex, and DeepSeek Harness in stable order. One choice launches
directly; multiple choices use a three-second crossterm countdown selector.
Navigation cancels auto-submit, and confirmation writes
`launcher.last_harness` atomically. That key is not consulted as
`harness.default` and never rewrites provider profiles. Explicit and
noninteractive invocations bypass the selector. DSH installation remains
user-owned while it is a developer preview; clud reports upstream's `npx`
command rather than performing a global npm install.

**Consequences:** Repeated bare launches are quick without silently changing
provider routing, `--deepseek` remains backward compatible, and DSH's unstable
grammar is isolated in the command adapter. The picker must restore terminal
state on every exit, and Claude/Codex-specific options must error for DSH
instead of becoming misleading no-ops.

## DD-045: Direct Codex-through-Claude uses provider-scoped gateway discovery

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** DD-038's one-row ceiling was correct for Claude Code 2.1.212, but
became stale after Claude Code 2.1.223 admitted clud's reserved
`clud-claude-*` gateway-discovery IDs and #912 implemented that protocol for
unified mode. The direct bridge still emitted `gpt-5.6-terra@medium` through
Claude's `--model` flag. That string was a bridge-private compound selector,
not an OpenAI model ID, so current Claude Code classified it as unknown,
presented one scalar custom row, and enforced its assumed 200K compaction
window despite the GPT-5.6 family's 1.05M context.

**Decision:** The direct bridge exposes `GET /v1/models` with exactly the
three registered Codex discovery rows. Known launch selections are emitted as
their discovery IDs; the bridge resolves those IDs before translation and
sends only the catalog wire ID to OpenAI. Ordinary effort is a separate Claude
session value. The provider-native `none` value remains a discovery-ID suffix
because Claude's CLI does not accept it. The direct child enables discovery,
scrubs the retired scalar custom-row variables, declares the 1,050,000-token
context ceiling, and adopts unified mode's Claude Code 2.1.223 version floor.
An inherited nonessential-traffic kill switch fails the launch because it
would silently disable the required discovery request.

This is provider-scoped discovery, not an alias for `--unified`: direct mode
keeps bearer authentication, Codex credential ownership, plan-mode and Task
suppression, and a catalog containing no Claude or DeepSeek routes. Legacy
wire IDs and `<model>@<effort>` remain accepted for continued sessions and
forward compatibility.

**Consequences:** `/model` honestly presents Sol, Terra, and Luna; the harness
never sees `gpt-5.6-terra@medium`; and auto-compaction no longer falls back to
200K solely because the model name is unknown. Direct and unified gateways now
share the discovery-ID contract while retaining different authentication and
provider-routing boundaries. DD-038's one-row decision remains historical for
pre-2.1.223 Claude Code and is superseded for supported clients.

## DD-046: One catalog row is the model-extension unit

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** zackees/clud#955. Two design audits followed the direct
Codex-through-Claude failure. The history audit found repeated churn across
model aliases, picker rows, effort transport, defaults, and context handling.
The extension audit traced a hypothetical fourth Codex model through native
Codex, direct Claude, unified Claude, launch plans, repeats, discovery, and
request translation. `provider_catalog.rs` already owned the three identifier
namespaces, but the translator still restated Terra as a default constant, the
direct overlay restated 1,050,000 tokens, and important bridge tests restated
three-element model arrays.

**Decision:** A `CatalogModel` row is the sole production model-extension
unit. It owns the clud/settings ID, provider wire ID, optional Claude discovery
ID, display metadata, aliases, capabilities/defaults, provider-default marker,
and Claude context metadata. Native harnesses consume the wire ID; Claude
gateways advertise the discovery ID and resolve it through the same row. The
Codex translator derives its fallback from the unique reviewed catalog
default. Provider-scoped Claude discovery derives its process-wide context
ceiling only when every advertised row declares the same value.

Conformance tests iterate catalog rows for native and Claude argv, discovery
advertisement, discovery-to-wire routing, and every supported effort. Separate
literal assertions remain only where they intentionally guard billing policy
(Terra is the reviewed default) or a historical upstream fixture. Unknown
reserved discovery IDs fail locally; unknown explicit provider wire IDs keep
the compatibility path.

**Consequences:** Adding a non-default Codex model requires one production
catalog-row edit, followed by normal documentation/review. Missing addressing
or context metadata fails tests or launch locally instead of degrading the
picker, choosing another paid model, or reviving Claude's unknown-model 200K
assumption. A future harness must consume an existing namespace or add one
explicit catalog field; private model tables and display-name inference are
not allowed.

## DD-047: `bash.block_cd` is a first-class setting, not a `bad_commands` rule

**Context:** A `cd` in a Bash tool call mutates the *session* cwd, not just
that command's. Every later tool call inherits the moved cwd, and anything
resolving a relative path against it breaks immediately. Project hooks are the
common casualty: they are conventionally written as repo-relative script paths
(`uv run python ci/hooks/check-on-stop.py`), so drift makes them ENOENT and
the session wedges — no tool can run until a human intervenes. The reported
case drifted *within* the same repo, so "stay inside the repo" is not a
sufficient rule.

Upstream will not fix the underlying behavior: the cwd contract is documented
as following the agent, and the tracker's own reports contradict each other
about whether cwd drifts or silently resets
(anthropics/claude-code#83636, #76708, #84685; the exact failure class in
#50960 and #42282 was closed NOT_PLANNED).

**Decision:** `bash.block_cd: "auto" | true | false` in `.clud/settings.json`,
defaulting to `"auto"`, enforced by `clud-cmd-scan` at PreToolUse.

The existing DD-016 `bad_commands` engine cannot express this. It matches an
executable plus argument-token predicates; deciding whether a `cd` target
escapes the registered roots requires *resolving* the argument against those
roots — path resolution, not pattern matching. A regex rule would either deny
all `cd` (too blunt: `cd src/` is harmless in most repos) or miss `cd ../..`,
`cd $HOME`, `cd %USERPROFILE%`, and absolute paths.

Four properties make the guard safe to default on:

1. **Only session-mutating `cd`s count.** A `cd` inside `(...)`, `$(...)`,
   backticks, or a nested shell runs in a child process and cannot leak, so it
   is always allowed. That keeps the recommended workaround —
   `(cd dir && cmd)` — available under every setting.
2. **`cd` back to a registered root is always allowed**, so a session whose cwd
   has already drifted can recover.
3. **`"auto"` resolves against the environment at fire time**, not at parse
   time: hooks that run relative script paths pin the cwd to the repo root;
   hooks that are all PATH binaries or absolute paths only forbid leaving the
   repo; no hooks means no policy at all.
4. **An unresolvable target is treated per policy, not guessed.** Strict denies
   it (it cannot prove the destination is a root); escape-only allows it (it
   has no evidence of an escape), matching the scanner's general habit of
   narrowing only on evidence.

**Alternatives rejected:** A `bad_commands` rule (cannot resolve paths, per
above). A plain `true|false` toggle — the right answer depends on what the
repo's hooks look like, which clud can determine, so it ships the opinion
rather than a knob. Forcing the cwd back from a `CwdChanged` handler as the
primary mechanism — cwd state is documented-unstable and shared across
concurrent subagents, so nothing may depend on it for correctness.

**Consequences:** Pinning is *hygiene*, not correctness. It protects the
agent's own relative-path commands and keeps the invariant the harness snaps
back to anyway; rooting hooks correctly is the dispatcher's job (#967 Phase
2+), and once a repo's hooks are dispatcher-managed and cwd-immune, `"auto"`
relaxes (#967 Phase 5). Two limits are deliberate and documented rather than
worked around: a `cd` performed by a sourced script is invisible to a
PreToolUse text scan (Phase 5's `CwdChanged` handler is the reactive backstop),
and once the cwd has already escaped, config discovery from the drifted cwd
finds no `.clud/settings.json`, so the policy resolves off — this layer
prevents drift, it cannot force a return.

## DD-048: clud runs a repo's declared hooks itself, and never writes them to a config file

**Context:** Harness hooks execute with the session cwd, which follows the
agent. A hook written as a repo-relative script path — the overwhelmingly
common shape — breaks the moment the agent `cd`s, and a *blocking* hook that
breaks wedges the session outright (DD-047 covers the preventive half; this is
the corrective one). Two adjacent failures share the cause: a nested repo's own
hooks never load, because the harness reads hooks only from the session root,
and the parent's hooks keep firing inside a nested checkout against files they
know nothing about.

**Decision:** A repo declares clud-managed hooks in `.clud/hooks.json`, and
clud executes them, with a fixed rooting contract: cwd and `CLUD_PROJECT_DIR`
are both the declaring repo's root, whatever the session cwd is. The harness's
payload is forwarded on stdin byte-for-byte, with the pipe closed so a hook
blocking in `json.load(sys.stdin)` receives EOF.

Three choices inside that are worth stating:

1. **A separate declaration file, not the harness's own settings.** A hook left
   in `.claude/settings.json` fires natively *and* through clud, and only
   clud's copy is rooted. Declaring is the explicit act that moves a hook from
   the harness's control to clud's; `hook_health` warns when the same command
   appears in both, because migrating means moving, not copying.
2. **Only exit 2 blocks.** A non-2 exit, a spawn failure, or a timeout warns
   and continues. This fails open deliberately: a guard that cannot run is a
   bug in the guard, and converting it into a wall in front of every tool call
   reproduces the exact wedge the feature exists to prevent. A blocking hook's
   stdout is relayed verbatim rather than re-wrapped, since it may be speaking
   the harness's own JSON protocol.
3. **A bare `clud-cmd-scan` still means `PreToolUse`.** Every already-installed
   hook line is bare; changing what those mean would silently repoint every
   existing user's guard. Other events are named with `--event <Event>`.

**Consequences:** Hooks become cwd-immune for repos that migrate, which is what
later phases build on — the typed root registry needs a loader it controls
before it can root a sub-repo's hooks at the sub-repo. Repos that do not
migrate are unaffected; discovery costs one `is_file` probe. clud is now
responsible for a contract the harness used to own, so divergence in matcher
semantics or exit-code handling is a real risk, mitigated by mirroring the
harness's rules and asserting them directly in tests.

## DD-049: settings reach the harness as compiled CLI arguments, never as file writes

**Context:** Delivering clud's hook set to the harness needs the harness to
read it from somewhere. The obvious route is writing hook lines into a settings
file — the checked-in `.claude/settings.json` (a dirty working tree on every
launch), or the gitignored `.claude/settings.local.json`.

**Decision:** clud compiles its settings into each frontend's native
configuration surface and passes them **as command-line arguments at launch**.
Claude takes `--settings <file-or-json>`, an *additional* source that merges
with the settings files rather than replacing them, with hook entries
concatenating across levels; codex takes repeated `-c key=value` overrides.
Neither path writes to a file the user owns.

clud already did exactly this for the bridge routes — `foreground_runtime.rs`
composes a settings document, writes it to a session-lifetime tempfile, injects
`--settings`, and merges into a user-supplied `--settings` so neither shadows
the other — so this generalizes an existing mechanism rather than inventing
one.

**Alternatives rejected:** Writing managed lines into a settings file, in any
location. It carries an idempotence requirement, a read-modify-write
lost-update risk (every existing writer rewrites the whole file, and only one
of them takes `~/.clud/settings.lock`), the two-writers-one-file fight that
caused #847, a per-repo assumption that the target is gitignored, and stale
state left behind when a session is killed. Argument injection has none of
those: there is nothing on disk to converge, and the tempfile dies with the
session.

**Consequences:** The Claude path becomes file-free.

*Update, verified while implementing (#967 Phase 2b):* the codex half of this
is worse than "no `--settings` equivalent" — codex has **no argument surface
for hooks at all**. `-c key=value` overrides values that would otherwise load
from `config.toml`, and codex hooks live in a separate `hooks.json` with no
flag pointing at an alternate one; `CODEX_HOME` would relocate auth and config
along with it. So the choice for codex was to write `~/.codex/hooks.json` or to
accept what the already-installed `clud-cmd-scan` PreToolUse line gives. clud
takes the second: codex keeps PreToolUse coverage (which runs declared hooks
since #980) and gets nothing for other events, matching codex's own apparent
single-event support. No second codex writer exists. One route deliberately left open: Claude's
`--setting-sources` can *exclude* a settings source outright (verified on the
shipped CLI — a project `SessionStart` hook fires under
`--setting-sources user,project` and does not under `--setting-sources user`),
which would let clud absorb a repo's existing hooks and fix repos with no
migration at all. Not taken yet, because excluding a source drops everything it
contributes: a bug there costs the user `permissions`, a security control, not
just hooks. It is strictly additive to this decision, so deferring it is free.
## DD-050: Route health is a second question, and failover is opt-in and cost-labeled

**Context:** #968. A session on OpenRouter's free daily tier ran out mid-loop.
Every later request died `429 ... free-models-per-day-stealth`, four scheduled
`/loop` wakeups burned against a dead account, and three `/model` switches
failed identically — because the model picker moves the model ID, not the
upstream. The base URL is fixed at process launch, so nothing reachable from
inside the session could leave the drained account. The only exit was killing
the session and paying a full uncached context re-read on `--resume`.

**Decision:** three choices that are not obvious from the code alone.

**1. Route health is a separate question from retry, and needs its own module.**
`codex_upstream` already answers "can this *attempt* succeed if I try again
right now?" and then discards the answer. Routing needs a longer-lived one:
"can this *route* serve at all, and until when?" The two are not the same
question. A drained account and a malformed request are both
`FailureClass::Permanent` to the retry loop and could not be more opposite to
a router — the first must move traffic elsewhere, the second must **never**
move it, because the next route would reject the same bytes and charge a
second account to do it. `route_health::RouteVerdict` names the six distinct
routing decisions; collapsing any two either strands a session on a dead route
or replays a bad request onto a paid fallback.

The ledger is launch-scoped, not global: a wedged account in one session must
never suppress a route in another. Clocks are passed in rather than read, so
every rule is testable without sleeping.

**2. The ladder is configured, never guessed, and every rung declares who
pays.** The default holds exactly one rung — the selected route — so a user who
has not asked for failover sees no change in behavior and no change in spend.
Descending onto a `CostOwner::Metered` rung requires consent recorded once
(`--failover-allow-metered`). Automatic recovery must not become an automatic
invoice; that is a worse failure than the outage being fixed.

Ordering matters and is the caller's: a switch inside one provider family costs
only a cold prompt cache, while crossing families additionally costs a Codex
reseed. Same-family rungs belong first.

**3. Replay happens only before commit.** `serve_messages` already documented
the seam — *"The status is chosen only while nothing has been written."* Before
the first frame the status is still ours, so a route-terminal failure is
re-issued against the next rung and the client sees one ordinary `200`. Context
survives trivially because Claude Code sends the full Anthropic-visible
transcript on every request: the gateway forwards what the client sent rather
than reconstructing it. After commit the status is spent, so the honest answer
is to end the turn — one turn lost, never the conversation.

**Rejected: a standalone `clud route status` command.** The gateway is
launch-scoped and its port and token are never serialized — the property that
keeps a launch's credentials off disk — so a separate process has nothing to
connect to. Building the CLI would require publishing a discovery file the
design deliberately avoids. Health is exposed on the gateway itself at
`GET /_clud/route/status`, beside the existing `/_clud/context/*`, with
`POST /_clud/route/clear` as the escape hatch for a clock-less drain (a spent
balance has no reset time, so after a top-up nothing else brings it back).

**Rejected: shrinking `max_tokens` to fit a balance.** The observed `402` reads
"requested up to 32000 tokens, but can only afford 1600". Trimming the request
to fit is the obvious-looking fix and the wrong one: it converts a billing
failure into a silently truncated answer.

## DD-051: Daemon creation is granted by a positive launch capability

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** The old `CLUD_NO_DAEMON=1` convention made daemon creation the
default for every newly added command path. A tool or hook invocation only
remained safe if every dispatcher and every child environment remembered to
set the negative flag. Version skew made that default dangerous: an older clud
reached through `ensure_daemon`, classified a newer daemon as merely
"different", and could terminate it while trying to replace it.

**Decision:** Daemon creation and replacement require the process-local
capability `CLUD_ALLOW_DAEMON_SPAWN=1`. Every clud process clears inherited
copies immediately after argument normalization. Only the normal command-less
backend launch path (including the normalized `clud run` spelling) sets it,
after utility, tool, auth, maintenance, daemon-control, and internal modes have
already dispatched. Tool children also strip the capability from their
materialized environment. Existing compatible daemons remain usable without
the capability; only daemon-state mutation is gated. `--no-daemon` remains the
explicit CLI opt-out. This supersedes the `CLUD_NO_DAEMON` portions of DD-011
and DD-012.

Daemon shutdown is an explicit recovery action and accepts callers regardless
of version. A shutdown request normally carries the expected daemon PID and
start time; the daemon rejects a different generation, but accepts legacy
requests that omit this field. If an older daemon rejects the request, the
client terminates only the recorded process identity. Implicit daemon creation
still refuses a newer daemon and explains how to stop or restart it explicitly.

**Consequences:** Adding a new subcommand cannot accidentally gain daemon-spawn
authority. `clud tool` and hook chains cannot inherit it. A utility mode may
talk to an already-running compatible daemon but gets a local permission error
if its operation would need to create or replace one. An older client that
encounters a newer daemon during normal launch leaves it untouched, emits the
yellow compatibility error, and exits 1. Explicit stop and restart can recover
from that version skew.

## DD-052: hook applicability is decided by a root's relationship to the session, not by path geometry

**Context:** A session touches files in more than one repo — the repo it was
launched in, temporary checkouts clud clones under `.extern-repos/`, and
organizational sub-repos a project declares. "Which hooks apply here" needs an
answer that does not reduce to "which directory is this under", because every
one of those lives *inside* the parent's tree.

**Decision:** Roots are registered with a **kind**, and the kind decides the
firing rule:

| kind | registered by | parent hooks fire there |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `parent` | the session root | yes |
| `extern` | immediate children of `.extern-repos/` (implicit) | **never** |
| `child` | declaration in `.clud/settings.json` | yes |
| unregistered | — | no |

An `extern` root is a temporary, foreign visit: the parent's guards are
meaningless against a repo it does not own and will not keep, and firing them
there is precisely the #841 ENOENT wedge. A declared `child` is the opposite —
part of the parent's world, so the parent's guards apply to it and its own
hooks run rooted at it.

Nested git repos are **not** auto-detected as children. Declaration is the
consent that makes the child tier's no-prompt trust sound (D8), and that
reasoning collapses when nothing was declared; a vendored dependency or a
stray clone would otherwise become a trusted root by accident.

**Containment comes from what a call names, never from cwd alone.** A subagent
editing `.extern-repos/<sub>/src/lib.rs` typically still has the session cwd at
the parent root, so a cwd-keyed rule would answer "parent" for a file that is
plainly not the parent's. Resolution order: the paths a tool names
(`file_path`, `notebook_path`, `path`); otherwise, for Bash, wherever the
command would `cd` to, because `cd .extern-repos/dep && make` does its work in
the sub-repo and cwd is only where it started; otherwise cwd. A call that spans
repos still earns the parent's guards for the parent's own files — any touched
path the parent owns is enough.

**Alternatives rejected:** A symmetric path-scoped rule ("a repo's hooks fire
for its own files, full stop"), which was the earlier draft. It cannot express
the difference between a visitor and a child, and those need opposite
parent-hook behavior. Auto-detecting nested git repos as children, which is
convenient and unsound for the reason above.

Also rejected, and worth naming because it is the shape one reaches for first:
treating `cd` targets as *additional* touched paths alongside cwd, then asking
whether **any** touched path is parent-owned. That keeps answering "yes" for
`cd .extern-repos/dep && make`, because cwd is still the parent — so the
parent's guards fire inside the sub-repo, which is exactly the failure this
tier exists to prevent. The targets have to **replace** cwd, not join it. This
was written, caught by an end-to-end test, and is now locked by
`a_cd_target_replaces_cwd_rather_than_joining_it`.

**Consequences:** The registry has to reach the hook process, and two of its
inputs — `--add-dir` targets and `permissions.additionalDirectories` — appear
in no hook payload, so clud carries them in `CLUD_HOOK_ROOTS` as JSON (a
path-separated list is ambiguous on Windows, where paths contain `:`). Roots
are matched most-specific-first, so a sub-repo nested inside the parent wins
its own containment lookup regardless of registration order. `bash.block_cd`
pinning now targets the whole registered set, so moving between the parent and
a registered sub-repo is allowed while wandering into an unregistered
directory is not.

## DD-053: foreign checkouts live beside the repo, not inside it

**Context:** clud cloned dependent repositories into `<repo>/.extern-repos/`.
Anything under the repo root has to be excluded by every tool pointed at that
root — linters, formatters, test collectors, IDE indexers, file watchers, build
scripts — and the list is unbounded, per-repo, and manual.

Measured on one developer machine: 23 repos carried the directory, 16 of them
empty husks left after GC removed their contents. The largest held **27,712
files** inside a repo. It had also stopped being a clone location and become a
dumping ground — scraped `.html` files in one repo, a `codex.tar.gz` in
another — and every worktree got its own copy of the same dependency.

The decisive evidence was in this repo's own lint script. `ci/banned_imports.py`
listed `extern-repos` among the directories it skips, but the directory is
`.extern-repos`; `Path.parts` yields the component verbatim, so the membership
test never matched. **The exclusion had never fired.** Every `bash lint` run
walked into every cloned dependency and scanned its Python. Nothing went red —
the symptom was only a slow lint and the occasional finding in somebody else's
code — which is exactly why it survived. Fixed separately in #987.

A probe across three layouts made the boundary precise. With the `.gitignore`
entry present, `git`, `ripgrep`, `ruff` and `pytest` all skip an in-tree
checkout — because `.extern-repos` is dot-prefixed *and* gitignored, two
coincidences rather than a design. Remove the entry and `ruff` walks in. And a
plain `Path('.').rglob('*.py')` walks in **either way**: it respects no ignore
file, and it is what repo CI scripts and build systems do.

**Decision:** Checkouts live in a sibling directory derived from the repo's own
name — `~/dev/myrepo` keeps them in `~/dev/myrepo-extern/`. No tool pointed at
the repo can reach them, so there is no exclusion to maintain and none to get
silently wrong.

Three details:

1. **Derived from the main repo root**, so `~/dev/myrepo` and a worktree at
   `~/dev/myrepo-wt-123` share `~/dev/myrepo-extern` instead of cloning the
   same dependency once per worktree.
2. **Claimed with a marker.** The name is guessed from the repo's own, so it
   might already be somebody's real project. clud writes a marker naming the
   owner and refuses to adopt a non-empty directory without one.
3. **The legacy location stays readable.** Discovery and the clone guard both
   still accept `<repo>/.extern-repos/`, so existing checkouts keep working
   while users move them.

**Consequences:** Containment becomes a **disjoint** question instead of a
nested one. DD-052's firing rule needed most-specific-first root matching and a
"parent hooks never fire in an extern root" rule stated as an exception,
precisely because the checkout sat inside the parent's tree. A sibling is
outside it, so the two sets never overlap and the rule follows from the layout.

Two costs are real. The location is now **fallible** — a repo at a filesystem
root has no parent to hold a sibling — where `repo_root.join(...)` never was;
callers get `Option` and the clone guard falls back to the legacy path rather
than becoming permissive. And a sibling is outside the project directory, so
the agent needs `--add-dir` to read what it just cloned; clud already harvests
and injects add-dirs (#967 Phase 3b), so that composes rather than adding a
mechanism.

GC needed a fourth watch root rather than a widening of the existing
sibling-clone one: that scanner inserts immediate children of the repo's
*parent*, while `<repo>-extern/dep` is a grandchild of it. Registry rows were
already keyed on absolute paths, so tracking and sweeping were unaffected.

**Alternative rejected:** a central cache at `~/.clud/extern/<repo-key>/`. It
solves the tooling problem equally well and avoids name collisions entirely,
but the path stops being self-describing — a user looking for what the agent
cloned has to know the hashing scheme instead of looking next to their repo.
For a directory users are expected to inspect and delete by hand, adjacency is
worth more than collision-freedom.

## DD-054: The model picker belongs to the harness, and discovery only adds rows

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** zackees/clud#995 reported a bridge-routed session wedged by an
ordinary `/model` selection: every turn failed with *There's an issue with the
selected model (`claude-opus-5[1m]`)* until the model was changed back.
zackees/clud#997 asked which of three things was true — discovery is not
consulted by the picker, it is consulted and merged with Claude Code's built-in
list, or the advertised set never reaches the picker.

The bridge's served set was already correct and constrained. `serve_codex_catalog`
and `serve_unified_catalog` (`codex_bridge.rs:1091`, `:1062`) answer
`GET /v1/models` from `provider_catalog::MODELS` filtered to rows carrying a
`discovery_id`, and `serve_unified_catalog` maps `ModelProvider::Claude => false`
outright. `claude-opus-5[1m]` is not a catalog row at all. So the ID did not come
from clud.

**The mechanism, read out of the Claude Code 2.1.233 binary.** The picker's
option list is assembled by one function that seeds a list from Claude Code's
built-in Anthropic lineup and then appends to it, once per source:
`ANTHROPIC_CUSTOM_MODEL_OPTION`, the gateway-discovered rows, the
`additionalModelOptionsCache` entries from Anthropic's bootstrap response, the
`availableModels` settings allowlist, and finally the currently selected model.
Every source pushes. **None filters the seed list.** The discovery helper returns
its rows for appending and drops any whose equivalent is already present.

Anthropic's [gateway protocol
reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway-protocol#model-discovery)
states the same contract: discovery "add[s] the returned models to the `/model`
picker", and if it fails "the picker falls back to the cached list from the
previous startup or to the built-in model list".

Discovery is additionally gated on the deployment mode being `firstParty`, which
is what a bare custom `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` yields — no `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_*`
provider variable is set. That is the same condition under which the built-in
lineup is emitted. **The precondition for discovery running at all is the
precondition for the built-in rows existing**, so they cannot be separated from
the gateway side.

The observed ID follows from the same reading. The built-in extended-context row
carries the alias value `opus[1m]`; a separate pass rewrites alias rows to
explicit first-party IDs whenever the user's `modelAccessCache` is non-empty or
an `availableModels` setting exists, turning `opus[1m]` into `claude-opus-5[1m]`.
Both inputs are the harness's, persisted in the user's global config from
ordinary Anthropic-authenticated sessions and refreshed behind clud's back.

Hypothesis 3 is ruled out empirically, not merely structurally: after a bridge
session, `~/.claude/cache/gateway-models.json` on the reporting machine held
exactly `clud-claude-codex-sol`, `-terra`, and `-luna` — the three rows
`serve_codex_catalog` serves, validated and cached under the bridge's loopback
base URL. The advertised set arrived intact and was still merged with the
built-ins rather than replacing them.

**Decision:** Record that the `/model` picker cannot be constrained from clud's
side, and stop documenting the opposite. Discovery is enabled and correct; its
contract is to *add* honest rows, not to bound the list. clud does not own the
picker and has no supported lever that subtracts from it.

The workarounds were each checked and each fails:

- **Declare a non-`firstParty` provider mode** to shed the built-in lineup. This
  disables discovery outright, so clud's own rows disappear with them.
- **`availableModels`.** Upstream documents it as bounding what *discovery* may
  add; it does not bound the built-in lineup, and on its own it only ever adds
  `claude-*` and `anthropic.*` IDs. Setting it also forces the alias-to-explicit
  rewrite described above, which makes the reported ID *more* likely to appear,
  not less.
- **Writing `additionalModelOptionsCache` or `modelAccessCache`.** Harness-owned
  caches that the harness overwrites on its next bootstrap. Already rejected for
  the same reason in [DD-038](#dd-038-the-codex-picker-gets-one-honest-row-always-carrying-the-catalog).
- **Tier hijacking** via `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL`. Rejected in DD-035 and
  DD-038 because it burns the Anthropic names and lies about what is running.

**Consequences:** #995's remedy is entirely detection and reporting —
zackees/clud#998 (a `failure_reason` on `LaunchRecord`), #999 (log the discovery
handshake), and #1000 (distinguish "not in the catalog" from "in the catalog but
not advertised"). No picker-constraining work is available to schedule, and this
record exists so that conclusion is not re-derived.

**Correction (same day, after zackees/clud#1005).** The first draft of this
record claimed a built-in Anthropic pick "reaches a gateway that cannot serve
it" on the direct route. That is wrong. `resolve_selection`
(`codex_translate.rs:748`) maps any requested ID starting with `claude` onto the
route's configured default, so such a pick is *served* on a Codex model — the
silent substitution [DD-038](#dd-038-the-codex-picker-gets-one-honest-row-always-carrying-the-catalog)
already recorded. Unresolvable non-`claude*` IDs are refused with a 400 before
the translator. **The mechanism of the `claude-opus-5[1m]` wedge reported in
#995 is therefore still unestablished**, because nothing logged it; that is what
#998 and #999 exist to fix. The decision above is unaffected — it concerns
whether the picker can be constrained, which it cannot.

This narrows, but does not overturn, [DD-045](#dd-045-direct-codex-through-claude-uses-provider-scoped-gateway-discovery).
Its decision stands: the direct bridge exposes exactly the registered Codex
discovery rows, and `/model` presents Sol, Terra, and Luna honestly. What DD-045
left implicit is that the picker presents them *in addition to* Claude Code's own
rows, not instead of them.

## DD-055: API logical sessions are durable records above worker generations

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** A daemon `SessionSnapshot` represents one worker process. Its PID,
attach socket, and exit code are intentionally worker-lifetime fields, and
existing reconciliation retires crash-leftover worker records. The API session
surface needs a provider conversation to survive normal turn completion and
daemon restart.

**Decision:** Persist `ApiSessionRecord`s separately under `api-sessions/`.
They own immutable canonical CWD, resolved settings, provider identity, logical
state, turn generations, bounded cursor events, and bounded idempotency. A
worker/process identity, when later recorded on a turn, is diagnostic only
after restart: the restarted daemon marks an active turn failed and never
signals a PID recovered from disk.

**Consequences:** Normal completion becomes `idle`, not a terminal worker exit,
and later lifecycle work can resume only a captured provider identity. The
existing attach/list/kill worker machinery remains compatible because it does
not accidentally classify logical API sessions as attachable workers. Bounded
event and idempotency retention prevents durable session metadata from becoming
an unbounded prompt/transcript store.

## DD-056: the command gate is an allowlist, and it fails closed

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #963's abstract interpreter (`block_bad_cmd_rm_vars.rs`) defends
against catastrophic deletes by *proving*, from command text, that a path
variable holds one nonempty literal path. That is 1100 lines answering a hard
question, and every parser bug in it is a bypass. The wider `bad_commands` /
`bad_pipelines` policy is a denylist: it enumerates bad shapes, so a gap in the
enumeration is a hole. Both fail open by design, which is correct for a
"friction-reducing nudge" but leaves no shape that is actually load-bearing
after a real incident.

**Decision:** Add a gate that requires every statement in a shell tool call to
be invoked through a wrapper (`tap` by default). The wrapper runs *after* shell
expansion, so it observes the real argv — an unset variable has already become
`/` and there is nothing left to prove. The hook's remaining job is the much
smaller one of guaranteeing the wrapper is on the path of every command.

Three properties follow deliberately, each inverting a surrounding convention:

1. **Allowlist, not denylist.** One command shape is permitted; everything else
   is denied. There is no enumeration to leave a gap in.
2. **Fails closed.** When `CLUD_CMD_GATE` is set to `enforce`, `1`, or `on`
   (surrounding whitespace ignored; anything else, including unset, leaves
   the gate off), `run_for_event`'s
   allow-by-default exits (unreadable stdin, empty/undecodable/unrecognized
   payload) become denials. A payload the hook cannot read is a command it
   cannot verify.
3. **Refuses what it cannot decompose.** Command substitution, subshells,
   process substitution, and control flow are denied rather than analyzed,
   because they run programs the gate would never inspect.

Property 3 is affordable only because of an asymmetry: when the interpreter
cannot decide, denying blocks legitimate work, so it is tuned to allow; when the
gate cannot decide, denying costs one extra tool call. Uncertainty is cheap
here, so the scanner spends it freely.

The gate does not reuse `command_words`, despite the overlap. That helper
unwraps `env`, `exec`, `command`, and `sudo` so denylist rules can find the real
program underneath — precisely the behavior that would let `env tap ...` satisfy
a prefix check. Reusing denylist machinery inside an allowlist reintroduces the
enumeration problem the allowlist exists to escape.

**Consequences:** Compound commands must be split across tool calls, and
control flow, command substitution and heredoc-free pipelines that mix wrapped
and unwrapped stages are refused; agents adapt to this from the denial message.
Coverage is depth-1: `tap make` does not confine the Makefile, which matches the
threat model (an agent slip in the tool-call string) but is not containment —
that remains a sandbox's job. Redirections are performed by the shell, not the
wrapper, so `tap cmd > "$VAR/out"` can still write to a mis-expanded path; a
redirect touches one file and cannot recurse, and `set -u` in the session shell
is the proportionate mitigation (shipped in #1066; see DD-067). Coverage is also per-session: only sessions
where clud set `CLUD_CMD_GATE` are gated, which is why `block_bad_cmd_rm_vars`
stays in place rather than being retired on arrival.

### Rollout, and how to turn it off (#1067)

`tap` v0 ships as the `tap` binary in `crates/tap`. It is not on by default.
clud sets `CLUD_CMD_GATE` only when you opt in with `CLUD_CMD_GATE_AUTO` (step 3
below).

The gate is controlled entirely by two environment variables, both read by
`block_bad_cmd_gate`:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `CLUD_CMD_GATE` | `enforce`, `1`, or `on` turns the gate on. Anything else, including unset, leaves it off. |
| `CLUD_CMD_GATE_PREFIX` | The required wrapper. Defaults to `tap`. |
| `CLUD_CMD_GATE_AUTO` | Read by clud, not the gate: `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` makes clud set `CLUD_CMD_GATE=enforce` in the session it launches, **only if** the wrapper resolves on that session's `PATH` and `CLUD_CMD_GATE` is not already set. |

**Disabling returns to post-#1064 behaviour exactly.** Unsetting
`CLUD_CMD_GATE` (and `CLUD_CMD_GATE_AUTO`, if you opted in) is the whole revert: the gate's own entry point short-circuits
on it before inspecting anything, so no other code path changes. Removing the
`tap` binary is not required and does nothing on its own -- an enabled gate
with no `tap` on `PATH` refuses everything, which is the failure-closed
direction but not a useful state.

The enablement sequence in #1067 is deliberately staged:

1. **Ship `tap` and dogfood it opt-in.** Done: `CLUD_CMD_GATE=enforce`.
2. **Measure the false-positive rate.** Done, by replay rather than a dogfood
   log: `clud-bench-gate-replay` (`--features bench`) runs every Bash command
   recorded in Claude Code transcripts through the gate's own classifier
   (`block_bad_cmd_gate::classify`) and reports counts only. On 2,538
   transcripts / 121,745 commands (2026-09-25):

   | Class | Share |
   |---|---|
   | Passes as written | 0.6% |
   | Passes once its one statement is prefixed | 11.9% |
   | Passes once each of several statements is prefixed | 71.8% |
   | **Refused even fully wrapped** (needs restructuring) | **15.7%** |

   The refused 15.7% is mostly command substitution (12,589), control flow
   (4,238) and subshells (1,801). A replay measures commands agents wrote
   *without* the gate, so it is the friction an agent would meet on first
   contact, not after it adapts. It is also the floor for step 4's decision.
3. **Opt-in, from clud.** Done: `CLUD_CMD_GATE_AUTO=1`. It is a child-env
   layer (`shell::cmd_gate`, next to nounset) rather than a `LaunchPlan`
   field, because `apply_child_env_policy` is the one builder both the
   foreground runner and the daemon use; a detached session is gated exactly
   like a foreground one with no new daemon wire field.
4. **Default-on — not taken.** One command in six would be refused outright
   even from an agent that wraps everything, and 72% would need several
   prefixes. That is not an affordable default. Revisit only with a gate that
   admits more shapes (for example, wrapped pipelines or `$(...)` whose body is
   itself wrapped), re-measured with the same replay.

Step 2 is not ceremony. The gate refuses compound commands, control flow, and
command substitution outright; that is affordable only if the rate at which it
refuses legitimate work is measured rather than assumed. Skipping to step 4
would make that assumption on every user's behalf at once.

## DD-057: a hook that cannot verify its payload denies removals and allows everything else

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `block_bad_cmd` is "a friction-reducing nudge, not a security
sandbox". It fails open on purpose, and `hook-dispatch.md` explains why: a guard
that cannot run must not wall off every tool call, because a wedged session is
the outcome the whole subsystem exists to prevent. `run_for_event` accordingly
had three unconditional allow exits — stdin truncated, payload undecodable,
payload shape unrecognized.

That default is wrong for exactly one class of command. #963 built an
interpreter that proves a removal's path variable holds one nonempty literal
path, but the interpreter only runs if the payload parses first. In the incident
behind #1064, it did not: a hook that could not read its input silently allowed
an `rm -rf "$VAR"/` that expanded to `rm -rf /`. Every other allowed-in-error
command can be undone. A recursive delete cannot.

**Decision:** Invert the default for removals only, on `PreToolUse` alone. When
the payload cannot be decoded or its shape recognized *and* the raw stdin bytes
name a removal program, deny. Everything else still fails open.

A read that stopped before EOF is deliberately *not* a trigger. It is recorded,
and it names the reason in the denial message, but on its own it means nothing
is wrong: Claude Code routinely writes a complete payload and then leaves the
pipe open (anthropics/claude-code#53177), which is why the idle timeout exists
at all. A genuinely truncated payload cuts a JSON string mid-flight and cannot
decode, so the decode check already covers it. An early draft treated the open
pipe as unverifiable and thereby denied every tool call whose text merely
mentioned `rm` — including #963's own safe-rewrite path — with retry advice that
could never succeed. That is the anti-wedge property failing, which is worse
than the bug being fixed.

Two consequences follow, and both are deliberate.

*The probe reads raw bytes, and is not the interpreter's probe.*
`contains_removal_program_text` reads shell command text that has already been
extracted from a payload. Here there is no extracted command — parsing is what
failed — so the input is a possibly-truncated JSON fragment, and three of its
properties break that probe: a newline inside a JSON string is the two
characters `\` and `n` rather than whitespace, so `cd /tmp\nrm -rf $SP/` reads a
literal `n` before the `rm`; truncation can stop the bytes immediately after
`rm`, leaving no following character; and the program may be named by path
(`/bin/rm`). `raw_payload_mentions_removal` therefore matches the removal as a
*word* — escapes collapse to separators, end-of-input is a boundary, a leading
directory is stripped. The interpreter's probe is left alone so #963's decisions
do not move.

*The probe over-matches on purpose.* `git rm` in a commit message trips it. That
costs one retry; under-matching costs a filesystem, and the probe only ever runs
on payloads that already failed to parse, so the false-positive population is
tiny to begin with.

**Consequences:** A removal whose payload the hook cannot read is refused, and
the agent retries it — in the worst case as its own tool call with literal
paths. The anti-wedge property is preserved for every other command and is
pinned from both sides: `unverifiable_payload_without_a_removal_still_fails_open`
covers a broken payload that has nothing to do with removal, and
`test_complete_payload_is_verified_even_when_stdin_never_reaches_eof` covers the
held-open pipe that actually regressed. A
regression there is worse than the bug this fixes, because it would wall off
every tool call whenever the hook hiccups. Truncation is genuinely exceptional
(a 1 MB cap, a 0.25 s idle timeout, a 2 s deadline), so this path is not on the
common route.

This is narrower than the command gate's inversion ([DD-056](#dd-056-the-command-gate-is-an-allowlist-and-it-fails-closed)),
which denies *everything* it cannot verify but only under `CLUD_CMD_GATE`. This
one needs no configuration and is always on, which is why it is scoped to the
single class where allow-on-error is unrecoverable.

## DD-058: the rm-variable interpreter reasons over resolved values, not literal token shape

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #963's interpreter and its #1064/#1068 hardening keyed the hazard on
the **literal token shape `$VAR/`** present in the command text: it value-checked
a removal operand only when a `/` sat textually adjacent to a recognized
expansion, and it identified the removal program by a literal `rm`/`rmdir`
token. A red-team sweep (#1070) showed that assumption is bypassable in many
unrelated ways, each confirmed to expand to `rm -rf /` in real bash while the
guard allowed it: the program named through a variable (`R=rm; $R -rf "$V"/`),
the slash or the whole root carried inside a value (`D=/; rm -rf "$D"`), the `/`
synthesized by an unmodeled parameter operator (`${V:0:1}`), ANSI-C quoting
(`$'\x2f'`), `$IFS` word-splitting, tilde and brace expansion, and a provable
rewrite that disabled the cross-statement fallback for its siblings.

**Decision:** Move the interpreter from *token-shape* reasoning to *value-flow*
reasoning (#1071–#1078, #1088):

- Resolve the program word through the same value/substitution model as
  operands, so a variable- or substitution-built `rm` is recognized.
- Value-check every removal operand after substituting known values, and
  propagate a `Hazard` value for a variable assigned an unprovable base — so a
  root reaches the check regardless of where the `/` came from.
- Decode ANSI-C `$'...'` in the lexer; treat unmodeled `${...}` operators,
  unquoted `$IFS`, leading tilde, and brace groups that can expand to a root as
  hazards.
- Run the `unproven_hazard_reason` fallback unconditionally, so a provable
  rewrite in one statement no longer suppresses the sweep for another.

**Scope broadened, but deliberately still incomplete.** The recursive-delete
verb set is widened past `rm`/`rmdir`/`find -delete` to a **curated, best-effort**
denylist of known idioms — Perl `File::Path` `rmtree`/`remove_tree`, Python
`shutil.rmtree`/`os.removedirs`, `rsync … --delete`, `find … -exec <deleter>`
(#1079) — fired only when a `$VAR/`-rooted operand is present. This is explicitly
not exhaustive: any interpreter can delete a tree, and enumerating them is a
losing race. Likewise the guard still reasons about command *text* before the
shell expands it, so constructs that only reveal their argv at runtime remain
out of reach. Those residual classes are why the post-expansion wrapper (#1067,
`tap`) and `set -u` (#1066) remain the durable answers; this decision closes the
text-time gaps that are closable and records that the rest are not.

**Consequences:** The benign corpus is unchanged — proven-literal removals still
rewrite, and near-misses (`echo $'\x41'`, `rm -rf ./~backup`, `rm -rf {a,b}.txt`,
`git rm`) stay allowed — pinned by `stress_benign_commands_are_not_swept_up`.
Each closed bypass is a regression test in `block_bad_cmd_rm_vars.rs`.

## DD-059: Direct provider launches carry effort on the session flag, and the reviewed default is low

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** A `clud --deepseek` session reported that `/effort` was overridden:
the direct Anthropic-compat overlay (`apply_anthropic_compat_overlay`) pinned
`CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL` to the selection's effort — `max`, once the catalog's
reviewed DeepSeek default applied. Claude Code treats that env var as a locked
override that beats `/effort`, `--effort`, and settings, so the picker could
never move the session. The pin was also redundant: `command::builder` already
emits `--effort <level>` whenever the resolved selection carries an effort,
catalog defaults included. The unified overlay (DD-042) already had the right
rule — preserve an ambient value, inject nothing — making direct mode the odd
one out.

**Decision:**

- The direct overlay neither injects nor scrubs `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`.
  The catalog default effort travels on the harness's own `--effort` session
  flag, which sets the *initial* value and leaves `/effort` live for the rest
  of the session. An ambient user-exported value is preserved and, per the
  harness's own precedence, wins over the flag — the user's own pin is their
  choice.
- The reviewed default effort for every Anthropic-compat direct row is now
  `low` instead of `max`: DeepSeek Pro and Flash, Kimi K3, and the OpenRouter
  Sonnet row all set `default_effort: Some(EffortLevel::Low)`. Flash
  previously had no default at all, which silently fell through to the
  overlay's `max` fallback; the catalog is now the single source of truth for
  direct-mode defaults.
- Unified mode is unchanged (DD-042): the harness resolves effort, clud
  applies no catalog default, and DeepSeek's documented five-name-to-two-level
  wire mapping still owns the server side.

**Consequences:** `/effort` is the live per-turn control in direct DeepSeek,
Kimi, and OpenRouter sessions, exactly as in unified mode. Sessions that
relied on the old implicit `max` now start at `low` and must opt up; DeepSeek's
server still maps `low`/`medium` to effective `high`. clud's `--effort` and
provider settings become initial values rather than locks. Subagent effort
follows the harness's own subagent policy instead of inheriting the removed
pin.

## DD-060: a foreign checkout's hooks run only after the user names it

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** An `extern` root is a checkout clud cloned or the user granted,
never a repo the session root owns (#966 §6, #967 Phase 4). Before Phase 4 the
dispatcher ran only the parent's hooks, so no decision was needed about the
extern's *own* hooks. Once the dispatcher learned a checkout's own declarations
(DD-061, D4), running them unprompted would hand a repo the agent merely
visited control over every tool call — the same trust leap as running the
parent's hooks in the extern, which #841 already showed wedges sessions. But
the repo's hooks are also the point of the visit: a checkout with a guard
claud would silently skip is no safer than one whose guard never ran.

**Decision:**

- A gc-tracked extern checkout's Tier-B hooks are **off** until the user runs
  `clud extern trust <name>`. The first sighting of an extern root that
  declares hooks prints one visible notice naming exactly that command, then
  keeps the hooks off — no prompt flow, no silent skip:
  `[clud] extern checkout "dep" declares hooks, but is not trusted; they are
  not running. Trust it with: clud extern trust dep`.
- Trust is an allowlist in the parent's gitignored `.clud/settings.local.json`
  under `hook_trust.extern` (DD-062), keyed by checkout **name + origin URL**.
  The origin is read from the checkout's `.git/config` in-process — both
  remote section spellings, quoted values, and worktree `gitdir:` files — and
  a checkout with no readable origin matches by name alone.
- Re-cloning the same name from a different origin does **not** carry trust:
  the origin is half of the key. A stale entry left behind by gc teardown is
  harmless — it names a checkout that no longer exists, and re-cloning the
  same origin is still trusted.
- Roots the user named at launch — `--add-dir` targets and
  `permissions.additionalDirectories`, harvested into `CLUD_HOOK_ROOTS` — are
  registered as `extern` but are **never** trust-gated: naming them is the
  consent, exactly as naming a checkout is.
- `clud extern trust` with `--list` and `--revoke` round-trips the store; a
  trust entry is per-parent-repo, not global.

**Consequences:** A foreign checkout cannot execute hooks until its owner says
so, in the same repo where the session runs, with one command the notice
spells out. The gate costs nothing when the checkout declares no hooks (the
sighting check only runs for extern roots that have any). Trust is
machine-local and gitignored, so it neither leaks origin URLs into history nor
travels to other machines. Opted-in `.clud/hooks.json` declarations in an
extern are gated exactly like frontend-settings declarations — the trust
boundary is the checkout, not the file format.

## DD-061: child and extern hooks fire rooted at the declaring repo, layered parent-first

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #966 §6 fixes which repo's *own* hooks run in a nested repo.
Before Phase 4 the firing matrix covered only the parent's hooks: always in
the parent, always in a declared `child`, never in an `extern` (the #841
wedge). The matrix said nothing about the nested repo's own declarations —
the harness never loads them at all, because it reads hooks only from the
session root. A nested repo's guard therefore never ran unless the session
happened to start there.

**Decision:**

- **Parent root:** the parent's Tier-B hooks fire for touches to parent- and
  child-owned paths only — never for an extern-owned path alone.
- **Child root:** declaration is consent, so a child's own hooks run with no
  prompt, rooted at the child. Denial is layered: Tier A first, then the
  parent's hooks, then the child's own; any deny denies. A call that touches
  only child files still gets the parent's guards, and a call spanning roots
  fires each distinct root once, parent first.
- **Extern root:** only the checkout's own hooks, rooted at the checkout,
  trust-gated (DD-060). The parent's hooks never fire there.
- **Tier B source for sub-repos (D4):** the opted-in `.clud/hooks.json` is
  preferred; otherwise clud reads `.claude/settings.json`,
  `.claude/settings.local.json`, and `.codex/hooks.json` — the files the
  frontend itself would run there. Both the group shape (`hooks.<Event>` of
  `{matcher, hooks:[...]}`) and the legacy direct shapes parse, non-`command`
  handler types are skipped, `hooks.state` (codex's own trust table) is never
  an event, and duplicates across files dedupe by (event, matcher, command).
- **Codex sessions** gate child and extern Tier-B execution behind codex's own
  project trust: `codex_project_trusted` reads `[projects."<key>"]` in
  `~/.codex/config.toml`, where `<key>` is the normalized project path.
  clud detects a codex session by the absence of `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` and does
  not run a repo's hooks there before codex itself would; the skip says so and
  names the fix.

**Consequences:** Every repo a session touches can be guarded by its own
hooks, rooted correctly regardless of where the agent stands, while the
parent's guards still cover everything it owns. Nested git repos are still
never auto-detected as children — declaration remains the consent that makes
the child tier's no-prompt trust sound. The parent's hooks and the extern's
hooks cannot both fire on one call, so there is no ambiguity about which
repo's guards apply in a foreign checkout.

## DD-062: trust state lives in the parent's gitignored `.clud/settings.local.json`

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** DD-014 split `.clud/settings.json` (tracked — the repo's
declaration) from `.clud/settings.local.json` (gitignored — the user's
overrides). The extern trust allowlist (DD-060) is machine-local state with
no business in history: entries encode the user's decision about a specific
checkout and its origin URL. It must survive clud restarts, be written by
`clud extern trust` from any cwd under the parent repo, and be read on every
tool call by the hook binary.

**Decision:**

- The trust store is the `hook_trust.extern` key of `<repo_root>/.clud/
  settings.local.json`, an array of `{name, origin}` records. `record` and
  `revoke` are read-modify-write: every other key in the file is preserved,
  so the file's human owners keep using it for their own overrides.
- Parsing is lenient in both directions: a missing, empty, or corrupt store
  reads as an empty allowlist (a launch must not die on a damaged local
  file), and an unparsable store does not prevent a later successful write.
- Names are validated (no separators, no leading dots) before they are
  recorded; `is_trusted` matches origin exactly, or by name alone when the
  checkout has no origin.

**Consequences:** Trust is scoped to one machine and one parent repo, never
committed, and readable without spawning a subprocess — the hook binary reads
the store directly on every dispatch. The cost of the lenient read is
theoretical (a corrupt file silently distrusts everything, which is the safe
direction: hooks stay off). Because the store is per-parent-repo, cloning the
parent elsewhere starts untrusted, which is the conservative default.

## DD-063: `"auto"` relaxes `bash.block_cd` only for repos fully on clud hooks

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** Phase 1 pinned every repo whose hooks were cwd-sensitive, with
`"auto"` resolving to strict-or-nothing from the raw frontend settings. Phase
2 made a repo's hooks dispatcher-managed once it opted into
`.clud/hooks.json`, which made the pinning unnecessary there: the dispatcher
roots every declared hook (cwd + `CLUD_PROJECT_DIR` = the declaring repo's
root, D10), so cwd drift no longer breaks them. Keeping such a repo strict
punished the migration — the exact behavior Phase 5 exists to remove. The
spec (D13) asks `"auto"` to be a three-level resolver whose relaxed level is
*earned*.

**Decision:**

- `"auto"` resolves to **strict** whenever any cwd-sensitive raw hook is in
  scope — `.claude/settings*.json`, `.codex/hooks.json`, or the user's home
  copies. The harness fires those hooks unrooted, so any drift breaks them;
  migration must not mask that.
- It resolves to **relaxed** when the repo is fully dispatcher-managed: a
  `.clud/hooks.json` opt-in (an empty file is not an opt-in) with no
  sensitive raw hooks. Relaxed denies only a `cd` whose resolved target
  escapes *every* registered root — the Phase 3 `CLUD_HOOK_ROOTS` set
  (parent, children, extern), not just the parent root — and allows all
  movement within them.
- It resolves to **off** when the repo has no hooks at all, or the session
  stands outside any repo.
- The scan records the opt-in as a `dispatcher_managed` flag; a declared
  hook's command text never counts toward sensitivity, because the
  dispatcher roots it. `"always"`/`"never"` stay as before.

**Consequences:** Migration is now a real upgrade — the repo earns
relaxation, and in-repo `cd`s stop being blocked. The strict level remains
the safe default for unmigrated repos, and a repo that keeps a sensitive raw
hook stays strict even after migrating, because that hook still fires
unrooted. The CwdChanged backstop (DD-064) is what makes relaxation
defensible: drift the scanner cannot see is detected reactively, warning
instead of blocking, because the relaxed invariant is no longer enforced at
PreToolUse alone.

## DD-064: cwd pinning and the CwdChanged backstop are hygiene, never correctness

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** `bash.block_cd` blocks a session-mutating `cd` before it runs,
but the PreToolUse scanner sees only `cd`s written in a tool call. An alias
or a script that chdirs moves the session cwd invisibly, and nothing in the
pinning path can see it. The harness's `CwdChanged` event fires on every
directory change — including those — but the upstream cwd contract is
unstable (anthropics/claude-code#83636, #76708, #84685), the event carries no
decision control (exit 2 only shows stderr; the change is not reverted), and
it arrived only in Claude Code 2.1.83. The spec (D12) asks for the reactive
backstop, but the feature must not become load-bearing on any of that.

**Decision:**

- The `CwdChanged` handler resolves `bash.block_cd` against the session
  parent root (`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, which stays put while cwd drifts) and
  prints a hygiene warning when the new cwd violates the policy; it never
  blocks. A declared `CwdChanged` hook's exit-2 is downgraded to a warning,
  because a refusal cannot be enforced after the fact.
- The handler always exits 0, so no payload shape, hook failure, or harness
  misbehavior can turn it into a wall.
- The line is registered only where a bounded per-launch capability probe
  (`claude --version`, floor 2.1.83) says the installed client fires the
  event; any probe failure degrades silently to no line. It rides only on
  opted-in repos, so a non-opted-in launch keeps its pre-Phase-2 argv
  exactly.

**Consequences:** PreToolUse pinning remains the correctness layer; the
backstop is a diagnostic that makes relaxation (DD-063) safe to offer. A
frontend regression that breaks `CwdChanged` — or stops exporting
`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` — costs users a missing warning, never a wedge. The
5-second probe adds nothing to launches without an opted-in repo, and a
hand-installed bare line still behaves (the handler is explicit-event-only
in the dispatch matrix).

## DD-065: PR CI waits are fail-fast, single-path, and cancel only the watched PR's own work

**Status:** Accepted

**Amendment:** DD-116 adds a session alias for the canonical PR-check watch;
the bundled watcher remains the single wait implementation.

**Context:** Agents waiting on PR checks kept waiting for *all* matrix lanes —
the Mac builds being the long pole — even after a fast Linux lane had already
gone red, jamming the pipeline for the length of the slowest runner. Raw
waiter commands (`gh pr checks --watch`, `gh run watch`, `gh pr merge --auto`,
hand-rolled polling loops) wait locally, cannot see a first error, and never
release the queued lanes they no longer care about. The `git.pr_wait_fail_fast`
deny existed but defaulted off, missed `gh pr merge --auto`, and — in gated
(`tap`) sessions — the gate prefix hid the `gh` program name from the guard.

**Decision:**

- **One wait path.** The bundled `github/pr_merge_watch.py` tool is the only
  PR-wait primitive. The `git.pr_wait_fail_fast` deny now defaults **on** and
  covers `gh pr checks --watch`, `gh run watch`, `gh pr merge --auto`, and
  polling loops; the guard strips the `tap` gate prefix before matching.
  Explicit opt-out stays available.
- **Fail fast, always.** The watcher exits the moment a check is red and never
  idles out the rest of the matrix: with no branch protection, no allowlist,
  *or* protection that names zero checks, every check counts as required. It
  polls every 20 seconds by default so a watching agent reacts quickly. An
  empty check rollup — a fresh push whose run has not registered yet — reads
  as "no data yet" and keeps polling, never as green.
- **Break off, scoped.** On failure exit the watcher cancels only the watched
  PR's own remaining workflow runs on its head SHA — never another PR's jobs.
  The agent's reaction (fix + push) then supersedes the stale run through the
  CI workflow's existing `concurrency` group, which cancels the prior matrix
  for the same PR. No global or cross-PR cancellation exists anywhere.

**Consequences:** A red fast lane surfaces in ≤20s with the failing check
named, first-error classified, and the PR's remaining lanes released instead
of occupying runners for the slowest build. The escape hatch
(`CLUD_BAD_CMD_OVERRIDE`, or flipping `git.pr_wait_fail_fast` off) remains for
deliberate raw use. Merge readiness still requires all required checks green
and `mergeable=MERGEABLE` — fail-fast shortens failure, it does not weaken
the green gate.

## DD-066: clud reports an untrusted workspace and never records the trust itself

**Context (issue #1102):** Claude Code gates a project's
`.claude/settings*.json` behind a per-project trust decision stored as
`projects["<abs cwd>"].hasTrustDialogAccepted` in `~/.claude.json`. Until that
flag is set it loads none of that file and prints its own red banner saying so
— at the top of every one of up to 200 iterations of an unattended
`clud grind`, where it scrolls away unread.

It is easy to dismiss: clud already injects `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
([DD-002](#dd-002-yolo-mode-is-the-default-safe-is-the-opt-out)), so the
dropped `permissions.allow` entries change nothing for tool gating. Everything
else the file configures is a different story — the repo gets a materially
different unattended run than the one its author gets interactively, and the
only signal is a banner nobody is watching.

**Decision:**

- **Say it once, in clud's own voice, before iteration 1.** The notice lives
  in `main.rs` above the `launch_mode` match, outside both `run_plan_*` loops
  and covering the centralized-daemon path with the same call.
- **Only when it can matter.** Silent unless the run is multi-iteration, the
  backend is Claude, the state file is readable *and* says untrusted, and the
  repo actually ships a `.claude/settings*.json` for that decision to suppress.
  A bare directory gets nothing.
- **The iteration gate is the point.** On a single interactive launch the
  harness's own banner is on screen and readable; a second one would be a
  double banner in the one case that never needed help. The unattended
  multi-iteration run is the one with no other way to surface this.
- **An unreadable or unparseable `~/.claude.json` is `Unknown`, not
  untrusted.** A fresh machine, a relocated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, and a
  half-written file must not tell a user their trusted workspace is untrusted.
- **clud never writes the flag, and the notice never coaches anyone into
  writing it by hand.** It points at the interactive prompt and stops there;
  a unit test asserts the text mentions neither `hasTrustDialogAccepted` nor
  `.claude.json`.

**Why not auto-trust?** Trust is the boundary that decides whether a
checkout's settings — including anything it declares that executes — are
honored. Accepting it on a user's behalf, in a tool whose premise is running
unattended in repos, makes clud the thing that disarms the check. The cost of
not doing it is one line of stderr per launch.

**The Codex asymmetry is deliberate, and worth naming.** clud *does* write
`[projects."<key>"] trust_level = "trusted"` into `~/.codex/config.toml`
(`hook_health/codex_trust.rs`, on by default via `auto_fix_hooks`). That is not
the same act: it is a hook-health *repair*, taken as part of installing clud's
own hooks into a project so they can run, reported in the repair output, and
opt-out-able with `--no-fix-hooks`. Flipping a Claude workspace to trusted to
silence an unrelated banner has none of that framing — the user asked clud to
run an agent, not to widen what a checkout is allowed to configure.

If a maintainer later wants the symmetric behavior, the shape already exists:
add a `RepairAction` alongside `AddCodexProjectTrust` so it lands under the
same reported, opt-out-able repair path. This decision is only that the
*notice* must not quietly become a write.

**Consequences:** An untrusted workspace with project settings is called out
once per launch instead of 200 times by someone else. A trusted workspace, a
non-Claude backend, a settings-free directory, and `--dry-run` all produce no
new output at all.

## DD-067: every clud-launched bash runs under `set -u`

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** DD-056 closes with the one hole its own allowlist cannot reach:
"Redirections are performed by the shell, not the wrapper, so
`tap cmd > "$VAR/out"` can still write to a mis-expanded path... and `set -u`
in the session shell is the proportionate mitigation." That mitigation was
named but never shipped. The incident class from #1064 is broader than
redirections: `rm -rf "$SP"/` with an unset `$SP` expands to `rm -rf /` before
any hook, gate, or wrapper sees an argv worth objecting to. Every defense clud
has operates on command text or on the post-expansion argv; none of them can
object to an expansion that has already silently become nothing.

**Decision:** clud sets `BASH_ENV` in the backend child environment to a
generated file that runs `set -u`. Non-interactive bash — which is what every
Bash tool call is — sources that file before executing the command, so an
unset expansion aborts the shell with a named variable instead of proceeding
with an empty string.

The mechanism was verified rather than assumed, because a mechanism that
silently does nothing reads as coverage that is not there. Measured inside a
live tool call: `echo $-` gives `hmtBc` (no `i`, so non-interactive, so
`BASH_ENV` is read), and the same shell prints `[]` for `${SP}` without our
overrides and dies with `SP: unbound variable` with them.

Three details are load-bearing:

1. **The user's own `BASH_ENV` is chained, and sourced *first*.** Skipping our
   injection when theirs is present would be a silent coverage gap; clobbering
   it would break their setup. Sourcing theirs *after* `set -u` would be worse
   than either: stock startup files routinely test unset variables
   (`[ -z "$PS1" ]`, `$SSH_AUTH_SOCK`), so every tool call would die pointing
   at *their* file for a policy they never opted into. Ours goes last, which
   also means a `set +u` in their file cannot leave us disarmed.
2. **The escape hatch is env-only.** `CLUD_NO_BASH_NOUNSET=1` (also `true`,
   `yes`, `on`) launches without it. Deliberately not repo-configurable,
   matching the `CLUD_HOOK_DISPATCH` precedent: a repo should not be able to
   switch off a safety default for whoever runs an agent inside it.
3. **Both child-env paths carry it.** They were deliberate duplicates when
   this was written (#933), and the daemon copy had already drifted; #1209
   collapsed them onto one policy owner, `runner::apply_child_env_policy`, so
   a policy now reaches both by construction. The parity test stays: it is
   what would catch a future re-fork of the two paths.

**Consequences:** This is a real behavior change for every clud-launched
session, which is why it ships alone with its own revert story. A tool call
that relied on an unset variable expanding to nothing now fails loudly; that
is the point, but it will surface latent sloppiness in existing scripts as new
errors. clud ships no bash of its own for this to break — its hooks are Python
— and since #1457 script files are not armed at all: non-interactive bash
reads `BASH_ENV` for script files too, which put third-party scripts such as
git's `git-sh-i18n` under nounset and broke `git submodule`. The generated
file now runs `set -u` only when `BASH_EXECUTION_STRING` is set, i.e. for a
`-c` command string, which is how the harness runs every Bash tool call. A
nested `bash -c` is still armed; a script file run by any program is not.
Unsetting `BASH_ENV` after arming was rejected because it would also disarm
the agent's own nested `bash -c` calls. The generated file is written atomically and only when its
content differs, so concurrent launches cannot hand a shell a half-written
file and leave it silently unarmed.

## DD-068: `grind` delegates looping to the interactive harness

**Status:** Accepted. Its direct `/loop look at …` prompt is superseded by
DD-087; the ban on clud-side looping stands.

**Context:** `grind` was mistakenly implemented as an external clud loop:
clud added a completion-marker prompt, chose a fixed iteration count, and
relaunched the backend after each turn. That design made a harness-native
`/loop` request look like a request for clud orchestration. It also produced
headless and stream-rendered variants that are not a normal terminal session.
Issue #897 and PRs #950 and #1045 contain this obsolete guidance or preserve
parts of it. They do not define the current contract.

**Decision:** `clud grind` launches exactly one normal foreground interactive
PTY session and places a generated `/loop ...` request in that harness prompt.
The selected harness owns repetition, completion, blocked state, and the rest
of the session lifecycle. clud does not inject or poll DONE/BLOCKED markers,
apply an iteration cap, relaunch or re-prompt the harness, use headless
`-p`/`exec`, invoke the repeat worker, or enable stream-json rendering.

Only a harness that supports `/loop` in its normal interactive prompt supports
`grind`. A harness without that capability fails explicitly before launch;
clud must not substitute its own external loop. The full execution contract is
owned by [architecture/grind.md](architecture/grind.md).

**Rationale:** The interactive harness already owns the user experience and
knows how its `/loop` command should continue and stop. Adding a second owner
creates conflicting lifecycle rules, hides interactive controls, and causes
future maintenance to preserve stale clud behavior because tests and old plans
appear to require it.

**Consequences:** `clud loop` remains the distinct external-loop command and
retains its marker, artifact, iteration, and repeat semantics. Legacy `grind`
tests that expect markers, repeated launches, a 200-turn cap, headless argv,
or stream-json setup are specifications of the defect and must be replaced.
The replacement tests assert one PTY backend launch, a `/loop` prompt, and no
external loop state or renderer.

## DD-069: the recursive-delegation guard refuses depth 2 outright, and is opt-in

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #812 records a deep-research run that created 101 agents before
it was stopped, and an upstream `/code-review` that created 877 descendants
despite a five-level nesting ceiling (anthropics/claude-code#77361). The
bridge's `Task` block (#796) and `DEFAULT_MAX_CONCURRENCY` (1 at the time, 2
since #989) only observe the overload after the agents exist; they returned
`503 bridge busy` to requests that had already been created. Claude Code offers
no invocation-wide agent budget and no depth setting
(anthropics/claude-code#79953).

**Decision:** `clud-cmd-scan` gains a rule with no depth counter: a call to
`Agent` or `Workflow` whose `PreToolUse` payload carries an `agent_id` is
denied. The harness sets that field only for a call made inside a subagent, so
absence means the primary session and presence means a child. Effective
direct-delegation depth is 1. The guard is off unless
`CLUD_BLOCK_RECURSIVE_AGENTS` is set to an enabling value, and the denial names
the caller, the rule id `clud_agent_depth_exceeded`, and the switch.

**Rationale:** A ceiling bounds depth, but fan-out at each level is what makes
the total exponential, so any ceiling large enough to be useful is already
large enough to be ruinous — 877 descendants happened *under* one. Refusing the
second level is the only bound that does not depend on the branching factor.
It lives in the existing hook rather than a per-launch injected settings
document because clud already runs that hook on every tool call under a `*`
matcher, and a second hook would be a second thing to trust, migrate, and keep
in step (DD-039's lesson about two installers). Opt-in for the same reason
`shell.disable_powershell` shipped off: denying agent creation changes what an
agent may do, and a wrong default breaks legitimate orchestration silently.

**Consequences:** Only tool-visible creation is bounded. A workflow script's
internal `agent()` calls emit no blocking event and remain uncontrolled; the
docs say so plainly, because an operator who believes fan-out is capped will
not go looking when it is not. A `Bash`-only matcher never delivers an `Agent`
event, so the README's `*` matcher is a requirement, not a suggestion. An
empty `agent_id` reads as the primary session, so a harness that emits `""`
cannot lock the top-level session out of delegating.

## DD-070: interactive Codex runs through the PTY pump on Linux/macOS and inherits the console on Windows

**Status:** Accepted; the Windows exception is superseded by DD-086.

**Context:** #1181. Codex's TUI writes every history line with an explicit
`\r\n`, but its `/goal` status cell hands the whole objective to one span
(`codex-rs/tui/src/goal_display.rs::goal_usage_summary`), so a pasted
multi-line objective reaches the terminal with bare `\n` while the terminal is
in raw mode with `OPOST` off. Each line starts where the previous one ended.
The Windows console masks this with its LF→CRLF output processing; Linux and
macOS terminals do not. Present in codex 0.154.0 and at upstream HEAD, and it
reproduces with plain `codex`, so clud is not the cause.

clud could not mask it either: since PR #47 the rule was "Codex with a parent
TTY runs as a subprocess inheriting the terminal", so no Codex bytes passed
through the pump. That rule was written because the old crossterm event loop
dropped Codex's startup `\x1b[6n` reply and Codex hung. The same PR replaced
that loop with the raw byte pump, which forwards query replies verbatim, so
the hang's mechanism was already gone. (The PR is titled `(#46)`, but #46 is
an unrelated CI issue; see #737.)

**Decision:** `resolve_launch_mode` picks PTY for interactive Codex on every
platform except Windows-with-a-TTY, which keeps subprocess. The pump chains a
stream-resumable bare-LF→CRLF filter (`codex_lf::CodexLfNormalizer`) after
the OSC title stripper, enabled only when the backend is Codex. `--subprocess`
and `--pty` still override the rule on every platform.

**Rationale:** Being in the byte path is the only way clud can give
Linux/macOS what the Windows console gives for free. Windows stays on
subprocess because ConPTY adds its own repaint layer (#515) and the console
already masks the bug, so wrapping there costs and gains nothing. The filter
is Codex-gated rather than global because a TUI may legitimately emit a bare
LF inside a scroll region and rely on the column staying put; Codex never does
in its own writes. Masking in clud rather than waiting for upstream because
until Codex ships the one-line fix every Linux/macOS user hits this on every
multi-line `/goal`.

**Consequences:** PTY mode also turns on clud's PTY-only features for Codex on
Linux/macOS (drag-drop path normalization, Ctrl+V image paste, F3 voice) and
the pump's 5 ms idle stdin poll (#691's cost table). The Windows guard is
`backend::tests::test_codex_interactive_with_tty_uses_subprocess_on_windows`,
which runs on the Windows exec lane; its Linux/macOS twin asserts PTY. Python
`--dry-run` tests are unaffected because they run without a TTY, where Codex
was already PTY.

## DD-071: toasts are composited inside the terminal stream, not drawn in an external window

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1189. clud's mid-session messages (the CPU banner) were
`eprintln!`ed onto the terminal a harness TUI was drawing on, with no
positioning, erasure, expiry or serialisation against the child's redraws, and
visibly corrupted Claude Code's footer. The ask was a semi-transparent toast,
anchored to the terminal, with a close button, that expires when no longer
relevant.

Two families were researched. **External overlay windows** (a layer-shell or
X11 surface positioned over the terminal window) work on KDE, Hyprland, Sway,
niri, COSMIC and X11, but need a geometry adapter per compositor (Hyprland and
Sway only by polling), cannot tell a single-instance terminal's windows apart
without title tricks (all kitty OS windows share one pid and class on KWin),
float over unrelated apps unless occlusion is tracked, need a Shell extension
on GNOME, and cannot work over SSH. **Compositing into the PTY stream** needs
clud to own the child's bytes (PTY mode), but is anchored by construction on
every desktop and over SSH.

**Decision:** Toasts are composited by the PTY pump's writer thread in tiers:
kitty graphics where the terminal fully supports it (kitty, Ghostty, WezTerm),
styled text cells on the alternate screen elsewhere, and a fallback surface
otherwise — Claude Code's own `statusLine` (clud composes one that chains the
user's existing status line) or the terminal title. Subprocess-mode Claude
launches use the status line. Sixel is not used. The external overlay window
is deferred.

**Rationale:** kitty graphics blend real alpha over text on a separate layer,
so removing a toast is deleting a placement — no repaint, no divergence from
the child's text model. Sixel has 1-bit transparency and replaces cells, so it
costs the same repaint as a text toast while only adding looks. Text cells are
restricted to the alternate screen because on the main screen a scroll pushes
them into the terminal's native scrollback permanently. The status line is the
only anchored surface Claude Code offers to an external process, and chaining
preserves the user's own line. clud never enables mouse tracking, because that
takes selection and wheel scrollback away from inline TUIs; the close button
is clickable only when the child already reports SGR mouse events.

**Consequences:**

- With toasts enabled, every Claude launch carries a launch-scoped
  `--settings` source for the `statusLine`. This deliberately breaks the
  earlier "a repo that has not opted in sees an identical launch" rule
  (`clud_hooks_compile.rs`); `[foreground.toasts] claude_statusline = false`
  restores the old argv.
- In PTY mode every child byte also feeds a `vt100` shadow and an escape
  tracker while toasts are enabled.
- Claude on Linux/macOS sees in-grid toasts only in PTY mode; since DD-086
  that is its interactive default, as it is for Codex (DD-070).
- Konsole and iTerm2 stay on text cells until their kitty graphics support is
  validated; `CLUD_TOAST_TIER` overrides the choice.
- Subprocess-mode Codex (Windows) has no toast surface.

## DD-072: server-side settings are one baked-in JSON document with per-section last-known-good

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1192. DeepSeek renames API model names in place.
`deepseek-v4-flash` became `deepseek-flash` with V4.1-Flash. clud compiled the
DeepSeek names into the binary, so following a rename required a clud release
and an upgrade. The first draft served a DeepSeek-only file. Review asked for a
general mechanism instead: settings baked into clud, plus robustness, so a
malformed server copy never breaks a client and clients carry on with what they
last had.

**Decision:** `crates/clud-bin/assets/server-settings.json` holds a
`schema_version` and a set of independently validated `sections`. The build
embeds the file as the built-in copy, and installed builds fetch the same path
from `main`.

- **Resolution.** Each section takes the first valid value among the copy served
  now, the last cached valid copy, and the built-in copy.
- **Section errors.** A present but invalid section keeps its last good value.
  An absent or `null` section resets to built-in.
- **Document errors.** A whole-document failure (bad JSON, a root that is not an
  object, an unsupported `schema_version`, `sections` missing) leaves the cache
  untouched.
- **Refresh.** A cache younger than 15 minutes is used without a request.
  Otherwise a background thread fetches, merges, and writes the cache
  atomically. The launch waits for it for at most 750 ms. After a failed
  attempt, clud does not retry for 15 minutes.
- **Parsing.** Strict: no duplicate keys, no trailing content, UTF-8 only,
  64 KiB cap, and nesting depth bounded.

**Rationale:**

- **Isolation per section.** One malformed setting cannot freeze or break
  another. [Firefox Remote Settings](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/services/settings/index.html)
  isolates collections for the same reason.
- **Last-known-good over rollback.** A broken edit on `main` leaves clients on
  the value they last validated, much like Chromium's variations "safe seed". A
  deliberate reset is still possible by removing the section.
- **One file for both copies.** The built-in copy cannot drift from the served
  one, and guard tests reject a document that is not strict JSON or that lacks
  a valid value for a registered section. So a broken edit fails CI before it
  can reach `main`.
- **Bounded latency.** On a healthy network an edit applies within one launch.
  Offline, the cost is at most 750 ms per 15 minutes.
- **Strict parsing.** `serde_json` silently keeps the last of duplicate keys,
  which is the wrong answer for hand-edited configuration served to every
  install.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **One typed struct for the whole file.** One bad field would invalidate every
  setting.
- **One file per setting.** It costs N requests per refresh and allows partial
  updates across files.
- **A signed manifest with per-section blobs.** It needs key management and a
  publishing pipeline, which is disproportionate for a few settings served over
  TLS from this repository. Deferred.
- **A synchronous fetch on first read.** It adds up to 2 s to a launch whenever
  the cache is stale.
- **Pure stale-while-revalidate.** Edits land one launch late, and short-lived
  commands can exit before the refresh finishes.
- **A daemon-owned refresh.** The daemon is not always running, and #542 asks
  that the daemon not grow new fixed-interval work.
- **A jsDelivr mirror.** It caches branches for 12 hours with no purge, so it
  can serve an older document than the local cache and roll values back.
- **ETag revalidation.** The document is under 1 KiB, so a 304 saves nothing
  measurable. Deferred.

**Consequences:**

- **Changes ship on merge, not release.** An edit to the JSON on `main` reaches
  installed builds within about 20 minutes (a 5-minute CDN cache plus 15 minutes
  of local freshness).
- **Adding a setting** takes a `Section` type, one `SECTIONS` entry, and its
  built-in value. The guard tests fail until all three agree.
- **Unknown sections are kept in the cache**, so a newer clud sharing
  `~/.clud/cache` still sees them. Bumping `schema_version` makes older builds
  ignore the whole document, so additive changes must not bump it.
- **Controls:** `CLUD_SERVER_SETTINGS=0` uses the built-in copy only;
  `CLUD_SERVER_SETTINGS_URL` points at a draft and bypasses the cache;
  `CLUD_VERBOSE_SERVER_SETTINGS=1` explains fallbacks.
- **Tests stay offline.** Library unit tests never fetch, and the subprocess
  test harnesses set `CLUD_SERVER_SETTINGS=0`.
- **A served DeepSeek default is visible**: `--dry-run` reports it as
  `model_source: server_default`.

## DD-073: every inline selector renders through one component

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1195. clud has three inline terminal selectors: the launch-setup
scope prompt, the bare-launch harness picker, and `clud settings`. Each owned
its own copy of the terminal plumbing:

- the raw-mode guard and cursor hide/show;
- draining pending input;
- key decoding;
- redraw arithmetic;
- line endings.

#1063 found that `writeln!` under raw mode walks diagonally on Linux and macOS,
because raw mode clears `OPOST` and a bare `\n` stops returning to column
zero. #1106 fixed only the scope prompt's copy, so the harness picker (#943)
and `clud settings` still shipped the bug. The copies had drifted in other ways
too:

- Only the picker ignored key releases, which crossterm reports as separate
  events on Windows.
- Each copy kept a hand-maintained line count for its cursor-up redraw.
- None of them counted rows that wrap at the terminal width.

**Decision:** `crates/clud-bin/src/selector.rs` owns all terminal I/O for inline
selectors:

- raw mode and cursor hide/show;
- draining pending input;
- one key decoder that ignores releases;
- the tick loop;
- CRLF-only rendering from a declarative `View`;
- physical row counts that include wraps;
- redraw and erase;
- a keep-or-erase exit.

A selector implements `Selector`: a view, a key handler, an optional tick, and
its exit style. The settings save prompt is a mode of the settings menu rather
than a second key loop.

**Rationale:**

- **Fixed once.** A rendering or input fix lands once and reaches every
  selector.
- **Derived row counts.** They come from the rendered frame rather than being
  maintained next to it, so a new row or a long wrapped note cannot desync the
  redraw.
- **Testable.** Terminal behaviour runs against a scripted terminal and a fake
  clock: countdown redraws, redraw arithmetic, and save-prompt flow.
- **Guarded.** A compile-time test forbids the migrated modules from enabling
  raw mode, reading events, or writing escape sequences themselves.

**Alternatives rejected:**

- **CRLF edits in each file.** That is the fix that already regressed.
- **A shared line-writer helper only.** The key loops and redraw arithmetic
  would keep diverging.
- **A TUI crate (`inquire`, `dialoguer`, `ratatui`).** A heavy dependency with a
  different look, usually an alternate screen, no countdown or value-cycling
  UX, and extra cross-build and wheel cost.

**Consequences:**

- A new inline selector implements `selector::Selector` and is added to
  `migrated_selectors_never_drive_the_terminal_themselves`.
- Hint, footer and note indentation is uniform. The `clud settings` save prompt
  is now indented like other footer lines.
- Ctrl-C and Ctrl-D close the frame the same way a normal exit does, then return
  `Interrupted`.

## DD-074: rm uses a PATH identity backstop and a post-expansion shim

Issue #1183's owner authorized validating executable lookup on the effective
PATH. The hook compares actual bytes to the packaged shim, while the executable
validates expanded operands. Neither layer replaces the other: expansion loses
source provenance and the executable cannot intercept non-rm deletions.

Real removal deliberately requires CI plus detected Docker. Unit-test builds
exclude the real executor. See [rm protection](architecture/rm-protection.md) for
the contract, supported platforms, retirement rationale and residual boundary.

---

## DD-075: Codex-via-Claude owns the workflow role aliases

**Context:** Claude Code workflows and subagents may request the built-in
`opus` and `sonnet` aliases even when `clud --codex --harness claude` launched
the session. The gateway cannot serve those Anthropic IDs. Before this decision,
the translator treated both as an unknown `claude*` ID and substituted the
launch default, collapsing workflows that deliberately used Opus for planning
and review and Sonnet for implementation onto one Codex tier.

**Decision:** The direct Codex-through-Claude child overlay removes ambient
role-alias settings and sets `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_OPUS_MODEL` to the advertised
Codex Sol discovery ID and `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_SONNET_MODEL` to the advertised
Codex Terra discovery ID. It also sets their display names to honest Codex
labels. Haiku is left harness-owned. The override does not apply to native
Claude or the unified gateway.

**Rationale:** This changes an upstream role request before it reaches the
bridge, preserving intended tier separation and making the picker labels match
what will be billed. It is narrower and more transparent than teaching the
translator to guess whether every `claude*` request came from a workflow,
subagent, or a user picker selection.

**Consequences:** Direct bridge sessions now map Opus-role work to Sol and
Sonnet-role work to Terra. The general picker limitation in DD-054 remains:
discovery cannot remove built-in Anthropic rows, and a user can still select
one. The aliases make that normal workflow path correct; they do not turn the
gateway into an Anthropic provider.

---

## DD-076: daemon worker environments start from the OS login baseline

**Context:** A daemon outlives the terminal that started it. Inheriting that
first terminal's environment made every later worker depend on an accident of
auto-start ordering: an activated virtual environment, transient toolchain
shim, or stale `PATH` could survive for days after the initiating shell exited.
The client overlay from #1157 fixes values the client sends, but cannot remove a
stale value that the current client does not contain.

**Decision:** The daemon materializes a standard login environment at startup,
refreshes it on every session admission plus a five-minute idle backstop, and
persists that exact base in each `WorkerLaunchSpec`. POSIX obtains it from a
bounded, clear-environment login-shell evaluation; Windows obtains it from the
machine and user environment registry keys, with normal `PATH` composition and
expand-string handling. Daemon-private protocol/lifecycle values layer above
that base; the initiating client's environment layers above both.

**Rationale:** The OS/login layer is deterministic for an account and excludes
an arbitrary session's activated state. Capturing it in the worker spec means a
new refresh safely affects only future workers, while older serialized specs
keep their legacy fallback during rolling upgrades. A `PATH` union would retain
a stale prefix and reproduce the original shadowing problem, so client `PATH`
is replacement-only.

**Consequences:** A login profile that fails or exceeds the bounded evaluation
time does not block sessions: the last known-good baseline remains in use.
Session-specific exports must travel in the client environment; clud does not
try to infer them from the daemon. Durable API session records still lack a
client environment and remain on their separately documented compatibility
path. The full contract is in [daemon environment](architecture/daemon-environment.md).

---

## DD-077: a launch-time model pin constrains every model slot, not just the main model

**Context:** #1257 amended [DD-054](#dd-054-the-model-picker-belongs-to-the-harness-and-discovery-only-adds-rows)
in the failure direction: `--model` only replaced `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`, so a
launch pinned to a non-Anthropic model still handed the harness independent
Fable/Opus/Sonnet/Haiku/subagent role mappings and an open gateway-discovery
catalog. The repro `clud --openrouter --model xiaomi/mimo-v2.6-flash` bounded
the main conversation, then quietly reached Claude through subagent and
discovery-picked rows the user believed were pinned away.

**Decision:** Every launch derives a model allowlist. Precedence:
`--allow-model` (repeatable; replaces rather than extends everything) ->
`--model` -> the previous model selection's wire id (the id `--dry-run`
reports as `model_selection`), which is the *only* pin when the user named no
model -- announced exactly once as a green
`[clud] info: no --model given; pinned to previous model selection: <id>`
startup line, green only on a TTY, plain text otherwise. Membership is
case-insensitive identity or same catalog row across the CLI, wire, discovery,
and legacy-alias namespaces; effort and `[1m]` context suffixes never change
which row was meant. Under a pin: a direct Anthropic-compat overlay sends
every role slot the pinned wire id and unsets
`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY` (a startup notice says so), with
an ambient `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` winning the subagent slot only when
it is itself inside the allowlist; the unified gateway pins slots to the
pinned id's discovery id and keeps discovery on but filters `/v1/models` to
the allowlist, because clud proxies that catalog; the codex-via-claude bridge
folds its own DD-038 opus/sonnet role rows into the boundary so clud never
refuses its own configuration. The bridge refuses an out-of-allowlist model
with `400 invalid_request_error` naming the allowed set and logs
`model_not_allowed`, exempting ids that contain `haiku` (the harness's
side-model machinery) or start with `claude` (the DD-038 substitution and the
caller's own Claude credential) -- the exemptions are per-request and do not
lift the main-model pin. An explicit allowlist outside which the resolved
selection falls fails at launch with exit code 2, before bootstrap. No pin
and no allowlist means an empty allowlist, and every consumer is
byte-for-byte the pre-#1257 behavior. `--dry-run` exposes `allowed_models`
and `pinned_from_previous_selection` so the boundary is auditable without a
paid request.

**Rationale:** An inherited pin is still a cost boundary the user is relying
on; a pin covering only the main model is not a boundary at all, because one
subagent turn or one `/model` pick escapes it. Reusing the resolved
selection as the default pin means a normal `clud --openrouter` session is
exactly as constrained as its own `--model` would be, with no new flag to
remember and no second picker to maintain -- discovery still only adds rows,
and the harness still owns the picker.

**Consequences:** DD-054 is amended, not overturned: discovery and `/model`
belong to the harness and still only add rows, but a constrained direct
launch asks for no discovery at all and announces that, while the picker's
built-in Anthropic rows remain reachable there through the bridge exemptions
for side-model traffic. A gateway pick outside a unified launch's boundary is
refused at the bridge with the allowlist in the message rather than silently
relabelled. Only the inherited pin is announced, because an explicit pin is
what the user just typed. The full slot contract is in
[provider-selection.md](architecture/provider-selection.md#openrouter-model-selection-contract).
## DD-078: OpenRouter context windows ride server-settings, refreshed from the provider's datasheet

**Context:** Claude Code clamps auto-compact to 200k for any model its catalog
does not describe, and clud only emits a window variable on an exact
static-catalog hit. Live OpenRouter inventory is deliberately absent from that
catalog (DD-054), so every newly listed OpenRouter model — starting with
`xiaomi/mimo-v2.6-flash`, whose real window is 1M — compacted far too early
(#1258). The fix needs exact windows for models clud has never heard of, kept
current without a release, from a config file stored in this repo that
downloads on its own.

**Decision:** Fold OpenRouter's public datasheet
(`GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/models`, `context_length` per row) into the
server-settings document (DD-072) as a `model_contexts` section — a flat
`{wire-id: tokens}` map — populated by a scheduled producer
(`ci/refresh_model_contexts.py`, run daily by the repository's first cron
workflow) that rewrites only its own section and exits non-zero on fetch or
parse failures. At launch, the Anthropic-compat overlay sets
`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` from that map when the catalog has no
reviewed `claude_max_context_tokens` for the wire ID: catalog wins, ambient
user values win, absent-in-both emits nothing.

**Rationale:** The fetch, cache, last-known-good, and per-section validation
machinery already exists and is the repo's single source for "changeable
without a release"; a sibling document would fork that lifecycle and create a
second owner per fact. Exact integers beat the harness's lossy `[1m]` boolean,
and teaching the harness the real window beats
`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_UNKNOWN_MODEL_WINDOW_ENFORCEMENT`, which only restores
wait-for-the-API failure at the limit. Catalog-wins keeps the reviewed goldens
(DeepSeek 786432, Kimi 1048576, Codex 1050000) authoritative.

**Consequences:** A new OpenRouter model's window reaches installed builds in
roughly twenty minutes after listing, with no release and no catalog edit,
preserving DD-054's boundary. A datasheet shape change turns the daily run red
for review instead of silently shrinking the map. The bounds are mirrored in
the producer and in `ModelContexts::validate`; changing one without the other
turns CI red.

## DD-079: A hung model request is reported where clud can see it, and is never mistaken for a clean end

**Context:** zackees/clud#1263. A direct `--openrouter --model
xiaomi/mimo-v2.6-flash --effort low` launch stalled for 4m39s with zero
assistant output: no error, no timeout, no retry, no spinner state in the
transcript, clud's logs, or the daemon events. The session looked dead and the
user interrupted it; the next turn answered in ~4s, so the API was healthy.
Auto-compaction was healthy and `totalAPIDuration` minus `withoutRetries`
differed by ~0.3s across a 112-minute session, so this was neither context
exhaustion nor a retry storm.

Three independent gaps produced it, and they are not the same gap:

1. **The direct route has no clud-side watchdog at all.** `--openrouter`
   conflicts with `--unified`, so routing is Direct and
   `apply_anthropic_compat_overlay` points the harness straight at
   `https://openrouter.ai/api`. clud is not in the request path and cannot see
   a byte of the stream. Every other overlay pushed `API_TIMEOUT_MS`
   (3 000 000 ms); this one did not, so a direct launch inherited the harness's
   undocumented client timeout and nothing said so.
2. **The bridge answered a timeout with the wrong status.** A transport
   timeout on the proxy hop returned 502 `api_error` — "this route is dead" —
   while 504 `timeout_error` ("retry me") already existed for every other
   timeout the bridge raises.
3. **A mid-stream failure was indistinguishable from success.** The proxy's
   read loop treated `Ok(0)` and `Err(_)` alike and then wrote the terminating
   chunk, so a truncated turn reached the client as a normally-finished one.

**Decision:** Fix each where it lives, and do not invent a fourth mechanism.

- `apply_anthropic_compat_overlay` pushes `API_TIMEOUT_MS` as a *default*, so
  all routes agree and an ambient user value still wins (DD-059's precedence),
  and the launch emits a notice naming the route and the effective value. This
  is the whole of what is available on the direct route: the only lever there
  is the harness's own client timeout, and clud can at least set it, log it,
  and say plainly that it cannot detect a hang on that path.
- The proxy hop distinguishes a timeout from a dead peer (`transport_timed_out`
  walks the `ureq` error chain for an `io::ErrorKind::TimedOut`, which is what
  a `WouldBlock` socket timeout normalizes to) and answers 504 for the former.
- The proxy hop's budget becomes genuinely byte-idle (see the DD-028
  amendment), and its read loop separates a clean `Ok(0)` EOF from an `Err`,
  reporting the latter as a sanitized in-band SSE `error` frame and logging it.

**Rationale:** The detector has to key on *received-byte idleness*, never on
turn duration. A model thinking for minutes is indistinguishable from a hang by
wall-clock alone — and this model thinks for minutes routinely — so a
turn-duration timeout would kill legitimate work. A healthy long think keeps
resetting an idle timer because it keeps emitting deltas; a dead connection
trips it. This is the shape DD-028 already specifies and the shape the reported
hang's own evidence supports: during the 4m39s window the transcript held zero
assistant records of any kind, not a partial or aborted one, which is a quiet
stream rather than slow generation.

**Consequences:** A stalled turn on a bridged route now ends in a named error
instead of a silent truncation, and a long healthy stream is no longer cut off
for outlasting its budget. The direct route still cannot be *detected* by clud
— that is a property of the routing mode, not a gap left open — so the honest
deliverable there is a known, logged timeout plus a notice saying clud is not
watching. Note also that the harness's own client path shows no spinner, error,
or retry state for a hung request; that remains an upstream gap, filed
separately.

**Superseded for descriptor-backed direct routes by DD-081:** The bridge's
3 000 000 ms API request budget remains unchanged; the direct route no longer
copies it merely to make the overlay values agree.

## DD-080: Codex updates use one verified subprocess, not a removal-shim exception

**Context:** zackees/clud#1271. The standalone Codex installer removes staging,
stale links, and temporary downloads while updating. Inside a CLUD-managed
session, those calls resolve to the #1183 removal shim and fail its CI plus
Docker gate, aborting the install before extraction.

**Decision:** Expose `clud codex-update` on Linux and reuse it for automatic
Codex bootstrap. Fetch only the fixed official release URL, reject redirects,
cap the response, and require an audited SHA-256. Execute that script with a
minimal child environment with OS-owned tools first; preserve only an existing
`~/.local/bin` PATH entry after them so profile handling remains faithful. Do
not alter the session PATH or the removal shim's gate. The child may remove its own installer staging
as the verified script directs. Arbitrary shell commands cannot supply script
contents, an install path, or deletion operands to this entry point.

**Rationale:** A shell receiving installer text from a pipe cannot prove the
text's origin to the removal shim. Parent-process ancestry or a user-set
environment token would grant the same exception to unrelated commands. A
deliberate update command gives CLUD a trust boundary it can verify before the
script executes, while the common session shell remains protected.

**Consequences:** The normal pipe-to-shell installer remains denied inside a
managed session; users run `clud codex-update` instead. Upstream installer
changes require a reviewed hash-pin update. A fixture exercises fresh,
already-complete, and stale-staging paths, and the normal gate is regression
tested for a nonexistent operand without CI evidence.

## DD-081: Direct routes do not lengthen Claude Code's API request timeout

**Context:** zackees/clud#1270. DD-079's bridge-era `API_TIMEOUT_MS=3000000`
(50 minutes) was copied to descriptor-backed direct routes without a direct-
route rationale. Claude Code documents a 600000 ms (10-minute) per-request
default. Current Claude Code versions also have separate streaming idle and
first-byte watchdogs, whose availability and defaults have changed across
versions. The API request timeout is not a clud-side stream-idle detector.

**Decision:** Set the direct-route `DIRECT_API_TIMEOUT_MS` to `600000`, while
retaining the bridge/unified `BRIDGE_API_TIMEOUT_MS=3000000` from DD-028.
Keep `push_default`, so an ambient `API_TIMEOUT_MS` wins unchanged.
The direct-route launch notice reports the effective value as a *Claude Code
API timeout* and says only that clud does not monitor this request. Do not
imply that a 10-minute timer detects every stalled stream or terminates a
whole agent turn. Stream watchdog behavior remains owned by the installed
Claude Code version; clud's bridge idle detector is independent of this value.

**Rationale:** A 50-minute pre-response stall was much longer than the
documented client default without any evidence that legitimate individual
requests require it. Matching the documented default restores the upstream
request budget while retaining an explicit, testable direct-route value.
For a request phase covered by `API_TIMEOUT_MS`, Claude Code surfaces its
timeout/error (and may retry according to its own policy); clud does not
observe or recover the direct request. A stalled streaming response is governed
by Claude Code's separate watchdogs, not guaranteed by this setting.

**Consequences:** Without an override, the direct notice changes from
`API timeout 3000000 ms; a hung request cannot be detected by clud on this
route -- set API_TIMEOUT_MS to override` to
`Claude Code API timeout 600000 ms (set API_TIMEOUT_MS to override); clud does
not monitor this request`. An explicit ambient value is still reported and
preserved. Bridge and unified route defaults do not change. The future
direct-route listener in #1263 remains the route for clud-owned per-request
progress and recovery.

## DD-082: Provider credentials need a verdict, not merely a vault record

**Context:** zackees/clud#1269. The presence-only preflight from #878 can
accept a corrupted vault value, launch a healthy-looking direct session, and
leave Claude Code to retry a provider 401 repeatedly. The last-four mask alone
cannot distinguish two otherwise different keys with the same suffix.

**Decision:** For descriptor-backed Anthropic-compatible providers, check the
stored value's shape locally and perform one bounded authenticated GET against
a provider-owned, non-generation endpoint on each live launch and auth-status
request. Treat 401/403 as rejected and stop a launch with exit 2; treat local
shape violations as malformed without making a request. Timeouts, connection
errors, redirects, and other inconclusive responses warn once and fail open.
Keep dry runs vault- and network-free. Preserve the native-vault boundary and
never put a key in a probe diagnostic. Report the provider's
message only after masking credential-shaped text and control characters;
include the stored value's length and short digest alongside its last-four
mask. Both command-line and interactive entry reject malformed values before
writing them. The interactive prompt masks accepted characters with asterisks
and supports Backspace, replacing #878's completely hidden input.

**Rationale:** A local CLI must remain usable offline, but a definitive auth
rejection should not waste a full session. A cheap provider-owned GET avoids
generation cost. The fingerprint is diagnostic only; it lets a user compare
what clud stored with what they intended without disclosing the key.

**Consequences:** Live launches can spend up to the configured probe budget
before the harness starts. Revocation is noticed on the next launch rather
than hidden behind a verdict cache. A valid 200 leaves the child env, argv,
and startup notices unchanged. Provider status can now distinguish missing,
malformed, rejected, and configured credentials.

## DD-083: Correct exact CLUD option spelling, reject near misses before passthrough

**Context:** zackees/clud#1268. The pre-split CLI grammar sent mistyped
DeepSeek selectors and nearby API keys to the backend as prompt text. Clap
could not suggest a correction because it never saw the unknown option.

**Decision:** In the top-level option region only, correct the exact
`-deepseek` alias and Unicode-dash spellings of public CLUD long options
before inline-key extraction. Probe unmatched flag names against clap's
top-level options individually. A near miss is an exit-2 error; an unknown
option followed by a key-shaped token also fails closed. Unrelated backend
flags continue byte-for-byte, and `--` remains the explicit escape hatch.
Bare-word near misses only emit a note because they may be prompts. Keep
execution argv intact, but share one key masker at launch-record, dry-run,
crash-report, and diagnostic output boundaries.

**Rationale:** Exact correction preserves intent without fuzzy routing;
clap's own suggestion remains the authority for uncertain flags. Output
redaction protects CLUD-owned surfaces without breaking web-terminal child
forwarding. Inline keys remain visible in shell history and process argv,
so native-vault entry is the safer credential path.

## DD-084: Transcript usage is the direct-route cumulative fallback

**Context:** zackees/clud#1267 reverses #1227's refusal to derive cumulative
tokens from Claude's undocumented JSONL transcript. Claude's documented
status-line callback exposes only the last request's token triple, and the
direct Claude, DeepSeek, Kimi, and OpenRouter routes do not have a bridge
ledger. A per-call number displayed beside an aggregate label is misleading.

**Decision:** Keep bridge-observed provider totals authoritative. Otherwise,
incrementally read the main transcript and sibling subagent JSONL, accepting
only complete integer usage objects with a response id. Deduplicate globally
across files and replays using session-lifetime SHA-256 id hashes; retain exact
cursors and hashes until the launch ends rather than evicting old ids. Store
the cumulative snapshot separately from the parent-owned toast file, guard
updates with a per-launch file lock, and atomically replace the snapshot. Both
Claude's status line and the PTY compositor read it. An absent or malformed
transcript never makes last-call counters masquerade as cumulative totals.

**Rationale:** Transcript usage is the harness's own record of provider counts,
not a tokenizer estimate. Hashed ids and paths enable replay-safe accounting
without persisting prompts, raw session ids, or agent ids. The status-line
callback already receives the transcript path, so direct routes need no
listener in the request path. Native Codex without that callback still needs
bridge-observed usage to display a triple.
## DD-085: Keep OpenRouter's changing price inventory separate from the model catalog

**Context:** zackees/clud#1256. OpenRouter's model inventory and token prices
change independently of clud releases, while the reviewed provider catalog
and harness-owned picker have separate compatibility contracts (DD-054).

**Decision:** Publish one additive, versioned JSON document from a scheduled
producer. It records normalized model rows, explicit text/tool/context/price
eligibility, and a convenience shortlist ranked by a 70% input, 20% output,
10% cached-input estimate. The consumer fetches only the fixed raw GitHub
document with redirects disabled and a bounded timeout, caches valid data
under daemon state, and falls back through the last good copy to an embedded
seed. Unknown fields remain compatible; the static catalog and picker do not
change.

**Rationale:** A price ranking is useful only when its population and token
mix are visible. Calling the results the lowest-priced *eligible* rows avoids
implying that provider metadata measures programming quality. Raw rows let a
later build apply another weighting without scraping OpenRouter at launch.

**Consequences:** Prices may be six hours stale on a healthy install, or older
when fetches keep failing. The producer fails visibly on invalid upstream data
and commits only validated deterministic output.

## DD-086: every console launch runs through the PTY pump; subprocess is for headless and redirected output

**Status:** Accepted. Supersedes DD-070's Windows exception.

**Context:** zackees/clud#691. Claude defaulted to subprocess since `a4ef5f5`
with no recorded rationale; every Claude-specific reason cited in code was
stale or mis-cited (#737). Codex kept subprocess on Windows (DD-070). Every
harness clud launches from a console is a TUI that expects a terminal; where
one ran as a subprocess, that was incidental rather than designed. Owning the
byte stream is what gives clud its PTY features (toasts DD-071, Ctrl+V image
paste, drag-drop path normalization, F3 voice).

**Decision:** One rule for every harness, command and platform. `--pty` /
`--subprocess` win. Otherwise PTY if and only if clud has a real terminal
(stdin and stdout both TTYs) and the launch is not headless (Claude
`-p`/`--print` from clud or passthrough, `codex exec`, DeepSeek's headless
profile). Everything else is subprocess: clud never fabricates a PTY when it
has no terminal. This retires the per-harness, per-platform, `clud loop` and
`grind` special cases and the `CLUD_PTY_DEFAULT` audit lever.

**Rationale:** The TTY gate avoids the one hard hazard: redirected stdout
(ConPTY hangs, and `clud -p ... > out.txt` must stay byte-exact). Headless
launches keep subprocess so stream-json and final output reach stdout
unmodified. ConPTY's attach repaint (#515) and the pump's idle polling are
real costs, but a harness TUI running without clud in its byte path loses
more than they cost; the pump budget is its own work item.

**Consequences:** Interactive sessions pay the pump's idle polling (#691's
cost table) on every platform. Claude `clud loop` runs `claude -p`, so it is
subprocess and streams progress through stream-json. Codex and `grind`
without a terminal are subprocess. Guard: `backend::launch_mode_tests`.

## DD-087: `grind` is a skill DAG with capped agent roles

**Status:** Accepted. Supersedes DD-068's prompt text and retires
`/clud-meta-work`.

**Context:** Two orchestrators had grown for the same job. `/clud-meta-work`
was a portable prose playbook with nothing enforcing it. A user-local
`meta-work` workflow was deterministic but required `act` under `bosn` for
every goal, built in a fresh worktree per goal, and admin-merged without
waiting for CI. That burned CPU, cold-started caches, and relied on prompts
alone to keep workers from building.

**Decision:** `clud grind` seeds `/grind`, a router skill over
`grind-intake → plan → work → review → integrate → land` leaf skills. A
bundled `grind` workflow runs the parallel and sequential modes; cron mode is
the harness's `/loop` over sequential runs of one issue each. Every workflow
agent runs as a bundled `grind-<role>` agent type whose `tools:` list is its
hard tool cap. Shell commands are capped per role by clud's existing
PreToolUse hook, which reads the payload's `agent_type`. One integrator
builds at a time, at most four other agents run at once, and `act` is
optional, offered only when Docker works and `ci.yml` exists.

**Rationale:** Skills keep each step readable and invocable on its own. The
workflow makes ordering, concurrency and fix-round limits deterministic.
Agent types plus the hook turn "workers do not build" from a request into a
rule. Reusing the native hook adds no per-call process: it already runs on
every shell call. Frontmatter-scoped hooks were tried and did not fire for
subagents.

**Consequences:** `grind` stays Claude-only; Codex keeps no inline fallback,
since the Workflow tool is the point. A new role needs its agent file, a
`claude_files.rs` entry and a policy in `block_bad_cmd_grind_caps.rs`. The
contract is owned by [architecture/grind.md](architecture/grind.md).

## DD-088: The PTY pump blocks on one event channel, and CI must prove it under a real console

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1310, following DD-086. Every console launch now runs through
the PTY pump, but its main loop polled stdin every 5 ms: about 200 idle
wakeups a second per session. Nothing measured that cost, since
`bench/idle_cpu` covered only daemon subprocess sessions. Nothing proved the
pump works on Windows either. CI ran every Rust harness with stdout piped, and
`require_pty_or_skip!` quietly skipped each PTY test when its canary failed.
Running the `pty` harness inside a pseudo-terminal with the skip turned into a
failure showed that 18 of its 22 Windows tests had never actually run.

**Decision:** stdin, `extra_rx`, resize, and the output reader's close notice
all feed one `PumpEvent` channel. The main loop blocks on it until the next
event or a 50 ms tick, which re-checks the interrupt flag, the hooks, and
Windows child exit. `bench/idle_cpu --mode pty` measures foreground `clud
--pty` sessions against committed N=1 and N=6 baselines, using a throwaway
HOME and working directory. `ci/run_bundle.py` runs the `pty` harness inside
a pseudo-terminal with `CLUD_REQUIRE_PTY=1`, and the canary answers ConPTY's
`ESC[6n` cursor query the way a terminal would. The `ci-windows` PR label
runs only static checks plus Windows x64, so Windows fixes iterate quickly.
`CI OK` passes exactly when those lanes pass. That is
safe because the merge queue always runs the full matrix. An always-red
gate was tried first, but `pr_merge_watch` cancels a run on the first red
`CI OK`, which made the label unusable.

**Rationale:** An event wakes the loop immediately, so keystroke latency
stays where DD-018 put it. Only the idle re-checks move to the tick.
Measured on Linux with the same host and 60 s windows, run back to back, one
idle session went from 11,314 to 1,221 context switches and from 1.89 to
0.92 CPU-seconds. Six sessions went from 69,692 to 7,335 and from 7.6 to 5.08.
A skip that reads as green is worse than no test, so the gate fails loudly
and prints the bytes the canary received.

**Consequences:** The Windows resize watcher (150 ms) and the
`console_input` adapter (100 ms slices) still poll. Making them event-driven
needs upstream `running-process` support. A dev build of clud must never see
the real HOME: it rewrites `~/.clud/state/rm-shim/rm`, and the installed
`clud-cmd-scan` hook then denies every shell command.

## DD-089: Claude commit/PR attribution is opt-in under clud

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1317. Claude Code adds a `Co-Authored-By: Claude …` trailer to
every commit and a "Generated with Claude Code" line to every PR body. It
exposes both as `attribution.commit` and `attribution.pr` in its settings
(`includeCoAuthoredBy` is the deprecated spelling), and an empty string hides
each one. No environment variable controls them.

**Decision:** clud hides both by default. `--coauthor` (or `CLUD_COAUTHOR=1`)
keeps Claude Code's own attribution, and `--coauthor=TAG` (or
`CLUD_COAUTHOR=TAG`) uses TAG for both. The choice is
`LaunchPlan::coauthor`, shown in `--dry-run`. The runtime merges it into the
launch's single `--settings` document, the same one hooks and the status line
use, and adds only the keys the user's own `--settings` left unset. The TAG is
`=`-joined only, so a bare `--coauthor` never swallows the next word.

**Rationale:** The trailer is a statement about authorship that the user, not
the harness, should choose to make. Carrying the choice on the plan rather
than on the plan's argv keeps every existing argv contract intact, including
a prompt that stays last. Settings the user wrote themselves outrank clud's
default. Codex and the DeepSeek harness add no such lines, so the flag does
nothing on them.

**Consequences:** Like the status line (DD-071), this makes every Claude
launch carry a launch-scoped `--settings`, even in a repo that declares no
hooks. `--coauthor` restores the old argv.

## DD-090: Test Claude Code integrations by mocking the model, not the harness

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** Everything clud installs into Claude Code (skills, agent types,
workflows, hooks) is interpreted by Claude Code itself. `mock-agent` replaces
the harness, so it can prove how clud *launches* Claude Code but nothing about
what Claude Code then *does*. `/grind` shipped with its workflow never
executed, and several of its assumptions were answerable only by running
it: do workflow agents' tool calls reach hooks, and how are skills rendered?

**Decision:** Add a third test tier that runs the real, pinned Claude Code
with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` pointed at `mock-agent serve`, which plays the
model from a per-role script (see `docs/architecture/testing-tiers.md`). The
`tests/harness/` fixture installs clud's real assets into an isolated config
with `clud install-assets --home`, and asserts on the requests that reached
the model, the hook log and the world state.

**Rationale:** Faking the model keeps the part under test real. A step keyed
on the assistant-turn count makes each request self-describing, so the server
needs no state, and Claude Code's extra user messages cannot desynchronize it.
It is opt-in because it needs an installed Claude Code; it runs in CI's full
mode against a pinned version, because the request shapes it answers are
version-specific.

**Consequences:** Upgrading the pinned Claude Code can break the tier and
should be done deliberately. The fixture has to work around clud's own
session machinery (the `python` shim, the rm-identity check), as its module
docs describe.

## DD-091: `/grind` gets repo lint/test scripts from a clud subcommand, asked once per run

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** zackees/clud#1336. Many repos ship `./lint` and `./test` entry
scripts, and `/grind`'s integrator should run them before every push. Finding
them depends on the platform (`.bat`/`.ps1` on Windows, extensionless or
`.sh` elsewhere), on whether the file is executable (`bash ./lint` if not),
and on what the script hands off to (`python -m ci.test` means `ci/test.py`).
A goal list can hold many goals from the same repository.

**Decision:** `clud grind-scripts` detects the scripts and prints each one's
kind, path, run command and the files to read for modes. The `/grind` router
gets that output through a `` !`clud grind-scripts` `` line, the way `/do` gets
`clud do-prompt` (#1322). The model's only job is to read the listed files
and pick out the user-facing modes. It never runs the scripts. The router asks
one question per run, records the answer as `scripts` in
`.clud/grind/run.json`, and passes it to the workflow as `args.verify`.

**Rationale:**

- **The subcommand, not the model, does detection.** The steps are fixed
  rules: which candidate wins, whether the file is executable, which
  interpreter to use. A model probing the filesystem could get any of them
  wrong, and a scripted-model harness can't test what it does. A subcommand is
  unit-tested, and the harness can check its rendered output in the router's
  first request. What's left for the model is reading, where it beats a
  regex, which can't follow delegation and picks up tool flags.
- **One question per run.** The scripts belong to the repository, not to a
  goal, so every goal gets the same answer. Asking once per goal would repeat
  the question N times. A workflow can't ask questions while it runs, so the
  router asks everything before it starts.

**Consequences:** If no scripts are detected, there's no question and the
planner's verify commands stand. When scripts are chosen, the planner only
supplies the goal's focused test. Adding a candidate or interpreter means
changing `grind_scripts.rs` and its tests, not the router text. The contract is
owned by [architecture/grind.md](architecture/grind.md#repository-linttest-scripts).

## DD-092: clud indexes Claude-harness sessions per cwd and recovers them portably

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #922. `clud -c` forwarded `--continue` and left the rest to
Claude Code, which cannot say which provider created a session, list a
directory's sessions, pick a compact checkpoint, or move a conversation onto
a model with a smaller window. A Codex-via-Claude session also keeps its
canonical history in the bridge process, so it cannot be resumed natively
once that process is gone. Claude's transcripts do hold everything needed,
but a local survey found thousands of them, so scanning on every launch is
the wrong steady state.

**Decision:** clud keeps a small per-cwd index under its state directory,
fed by a `clud session-hook` that every Claude-harness launch registers for
`SessionStart`, `PostCompact` and `SessionEnd` with the route resolved in the
`LaunchPlan`. Existing transcripts are imported once per cwd, with the route
inferred from the model name and flagged as such. At a terminal, `clud -c`
opens a picker, and `--last` takes the newest session. `--resume-mode auto`
resumes natively when that is safe. It uses a forked native resume for a
compatible provider switch, and portable recovery otherwise: a new session
seeded through `SessionStart.additionalContext` with a marked, truncated
context (compact summary plus the newest whole turns within half the
destination window). Without a terminal, `-c` keeps Claude's `--continue`.

**Rationale:**
- The transcript stays the only source of conversation content, so the index
  can't drift from it. It holds pointers and metadata, and a corrupt index is
  simply rebuilt.
- Recording the route at launch is authoritative. Model names are ambiguous
  across gateways, so they are used only for legacy import, and an inferred
  route never overwrites a recorded one.
- The size estimate uses the content a resume would replay, never cumulative
  usage, which overstates the live context by orders of magnitude.
- Following `parentUuid` rather than file order is what makes a rewound
  session recover the branch the user was actually on.

**Consequences:**
- Every Claude-harness launch now carries clud's session hook in its
  launch-scoped `--settings`, in the same way the status line (DD-071) and
  attribution (DD-089) are carried.
- Previews, summaries and recovery files are local sensitive data. They are
  locked, written atomically, owner-only, and kept out of logs and `--dry-run`.
- Native Codex-harness history is out of scope.


## DD-093: Anthropic-compatible providers are descriptor rows, and the gateway routes them as one list

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #936 and #937. DeepSeek arrived first and was wired by hand:
its own vault identifiers, overlay function, preflight, settings strings, and
two gateway fields (`deepseek_api_key`, `deepseek_base_url`) with matching
`match` arms. OpenRouter copied the pattern. Adding Kimi that way would have
meant a third copy at every site, and the silent fallbacks (`_ =>` arms,
hand-written provider arrays) meant a missed site would route a request to the
wrong provider rather than fail to compile.

**Decision:** An Anthropic-compatible provider is one `&'static`
`AnthropicCompatProvider` row in `provider_registry::ANTHROPIC_COMPAT_PROVIDERS`
plus its `provider_catalog::MODELS` rows. Shared code (vault access, preflight,
child-env overlay, settings, TUI, auth) is parameterized by the row. The
unified gateway holds one `AnthropicCompatRoute { provider, base_url, api_key }`
per provider whose key the launch holds, and a single `provider_available`
predicate drives discovery, the refusal ID list, and dispatch. Kimi is routed
directly to Moonshot's Anthropic-compatible endpoint, never through a
translation bridge.

**Rationale:**
- A data table beats a `dyn Provider` trait: every provider is known at
  compile time, the rows are plain data a test can iterate, and it matches the
  repository's existing registries (`CatalogModel`, `BUNDLED_SKILLS`,
  `BUNDLED_TOOLS`). A trait would add dynamic dispatch and hide the
  differences, which are all data, behind methods.
- Guardrail tests iterating `ModelProvider::ALL` turn a forgotten site into a
  test failure instead of a silent fallback.
- Direct routing keeps Kimi's credential on one hop: clud's vault to the
  gateway (or child env) to Moonshot. A translation bridge would add a
  second process holding the key and a second protocol to keep faithful, for
  an endpoint that already speaks Anthropic Messages.
- Vault identifiers are part of the stored credential's address, so each
  row's `vault_service`/`vault_account` is frozen by a test. Renaming one
  orphans every key already stored under it.

**Consequences:**
- A new Anthropic-compatible provider is a descriptor row, a catalog row, an
  enum variant, and its clap flag; CLAUDE.md's "New model provider" entry lists
  the steps and the test that catches each omission.
- Provider-side gaps are documented, not repaired: Kimi's endpoint does not
  support Claude Code's WebFetch, and clud does not emulate it.
- Credentials still never cross the daemon wire, `LaunchPlan`, or dry-run
  output; the route list lives only inside the launch-scoped gateway.

## DD-094: `gh pr merge --auto` is allowed; only local watchers are denied

**Status:** Accepted (amends DD-065)

**Amendment:** DD-116 permits the canonical PR-check watch when the session
alias is active; run-id watches remain denied.

**Context:** DD-065 put `gh pr merge --auto` on the `git.pr_wait_fail_fast`
deny list next to `gh pr checks --watch`. But `--auto` does not wait locally:
it enqueues the merge with GitHub and returns at once, so it never ties up an
agent the way a local watcher does, and it is the normal way to say "merge
when green".

**Decision:** The guard denies only local waiters (`gh pr checks --watch`,
`gh run watch`, hand-rolled polling loops), which `pr_merge_watch.py`
replaces because it fails fast. `gh pr merge --auto` is allowed.

**Consequences:** A red lane on an auto-merge PR no longer cancels the rest
of the matrix unless someone also runs `pr_merge_watch.py`; the merge simply
never happens. That is an acceptable cost for keeping GitHub's native
auto-merge available.

## DD-095: The /grind feature lands as a merge commit, and main is merged into the feature branch rather than rebased

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1410, spec #1392 §6. In feature-branch mode each goal PR merges
into `grind/meta-<M>-<run-id>`, and only one feature PR reaches `<main>`.
There are three ways that PR could land, and two ways to bring in a `<main>`
that moved during the run.

**Decision:** The feature PR always lands as a merge commit (`--no-ff`,
`gh pr merge --merge`), whoever merges it. When `<main>` moves, grind merges
`<main>` into the feature branch and never rebases it.

**Rationale:**
- The goal commits that land are the ones that were tested, SHA for SHA, so
  nothing needs re-testing.
- History keeps one commit per goal.
- `git revert -m1 <merge>` undoes the whole feature in one step.
- A rebase replays N goal commits onto the moved `<main>`, so the code that
  lands is not the code that was tested. On a long refactor it also forces
  conflict resolution one commit at a time, and undoing the feature means
  reverting N commits. A squash is easy to revert but loses per-goal history.

**Consequences:** `<main>` gets one merge commit per feature and the feature
branch may carry merge commits from `<main>`. The hook refuses `--admin` on
the feature PR, and the lander merges it only under `feature_merge: auto`.
The contract is owned by
[architecture/grind.md](architecture/grind.md#feature-branch-mode).

## DD-096: The feature PR is the single closer of /grind issues, and `clud grind reconcile` reopens early closes

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1393. In feature-branch mode a child's fix merges into
`grind/meta-<M>-<run-id>`, not `<main>`. GitHub closes an issue from a
closing keyword only when the PR merges into the default branch, but people
and tools still close issues early: by hand mid-run, from a PR merged into a
non-default base, or from a commit that never reaches `<main>`. If the
feature PR is then closed unmerged, those issues read as done while their fix
exists only at `refs/pull/<N>/head`. Nothing on GitHub records which feature
PR an issue is waiting on.

**Decision:**
- **One closer.** Goal PRs say `Refs #N`; only the feature PR carries
  `Closes #N` (and `Closes #<meta>`), so GitHub closes each issue exactly when
  its fix reaches `<main>`. No grind role closes an issue by hand.
- **Label plus marker.** The lander labels every issue whose goal merged into
  the feature branch `grind:on-feature` and posts
  `<!-- grind:v1 feature-pr=#N branch=... goal-pr=#G run=... -->`. The label
  makes the set queryable; the marker says which PR it waits on.
- **Reconcile.** `clud grind reconcile` (run by the `/grind` router and each
  `/grind-cron` tick) walks every labelled issue. An issue closed by anything
  other than a merge into `<main>` (or a commit reachable from `<main>`) is
  reopened while its feature PR is unlanded. A feature PR closed unmerged
  reopens and unlabels its issues and cites `refs/pull/N/head`. A feature PR
  merged into `<main>` closes any stragglers and removes the label.

**Rationale:** GitHub's own closing semantics already mean "the fix is on the
default branch"; making the feature PR the only closer reuses them instead of
simulating them. Reconcile is idempotent and reads only GitHub state, so it
can run on every tick and repair damage done outside grind.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Projects v2 status field | Needs a project per repo and extra token scopes; a label and a comment work with the default `gh` login and are visible on the issue itself. |
| Milestones | One milestone per issue, often already used for releases; it cannot name the PR an issue waits on. |
| Rulesets / branch protection | They gate merges, not issue state; nothing stops a hand close. |
| Close on goal merge, reopen on failure | Issues read as fixed while the fix is off `<main>`, the exact state #1393 forbids. |

**Consequences:** An issue can be closed early, but only until the next
reconcile. The label is removed only when the feature PR has merged or been
closed, so an open label always means "fix pending on a feature branch".
Intake skips `grind:on-feature` issues. The contract is owned by

## DD-097: The /grind run plans before it asks: one up-front question round, none after prework

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1407, spec #1392 §0 and §2. A workflow cannot ask questions
while it runs, and `/grind` runs unattended for hours. Earlier drafts asked
questions as they came up: repo state at the start, feature grouping after
planning, the merge policy when the feature PR opened. Each one stalled a run
the user had walked away from, and a question about grouping cannot be asked
well before the children have been classified.

**Decision:** The router routes the input, runs a plan-only classification
pass (no edits, worktrees or pushes), inspects repo state, and only then asks
**one** question round of at most two `AskUserQuestion` calls. Every answer
(dirty-repo action, regroup, mode, models, CI, scripts, feature merge policy,
problem reporting) is recorded in `run.json` and the plan before prework
starts. From prework on nobody asks: the hook denies `AskUserQuestion` to
every `grind-*` subagent, and anything unexpected follows a rule recorded in
advance (`stuck_bug`, `no_overlap`, `problem_reporting`).

**Rationale:**
- Planning first means the questions are about a concrete plan, so the user
  answers once with the facts in front of them.
- One round bounds interruption: after it the user can leave.
- Recorded rules make every mid-run decision reproducible from the plan
  comment, which nobody edits.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Ask as questions arise | Stalls an unattended run at an unknown time. |
| Ask before planning | Grouping and merge-policy questions would be guesses. |
| No questions, fixed defaults | Dirty-repo handling and merge policy are the user's call. |

**Consequences:** The plan-only pass costs one planner agent before any
question. Intake's conversion (or pick) question stays separate and precedes
the round, because it decides what the meta issue is. The contract is owned by
[architecture/grind.md](architecture/grind.md#preflight-and-the-single-question-round).

## DD-098: /grind follow-up issues are never sub-issues of the meta

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1411, spec #1392. Roles find problems outside their goal's
scope. Filed as sub-issues of the meta issue, they would widen the run's
scope while it runs: the meta could not close until they were fixed, and the
no-overlap check and reconcile would count them.

**Decision:** Roles return problems; only the router files them. Under
`problem_reporting: issue` each becomes an issue labelled `grind:followup`,
with `Refs #<meta>` and a `<!-- grind:followup ... -->` marker naming its
stage and feature PR, and it is never attached as a sub-issue of the meta.
Intake and cron pick a follow-up up later: at once for the bug stage, and
after the feature PR merges for a feature stage.

**Rationale:** The meta's sub-issue list stays exactly the run's scope, so
closing the meta, the no-overlap check and reconcile act on precisely the
issues the run planned. The label and marker keep follow-ups queryable and
linked without that coupling.

**Consequences:** A follow-up is visible from the meta only through its
`Refs` backlink. A failed filing is listed in the router's final report
rather than stopping the run. The contract is owned by
[architecture/grind.md](architecture/grind.md#problem-reporting).

## DD-099: A /grind review never rejects for unrun checks, and a failed sequential goal is parked

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1424. The reviewer cannot build, lint or test, yet its skill
said to reject when the goal "cannot be made correct without running
something". A reviewer rejected goal #1402 because "nothing has been run
yet", and the goal was dropped. In sequential mode that goal's uncommitted
files stayed in the shared checkout: the next goals' lint picked them up,
integrators stashed around them, and a dependent was planned on top of them.

**Decision:** The reviewer approves on reading and lists the checks it
wants under `must_verify`, which `grind-run.js` appends to the goal's verify
commands. A rejection whose summary only says nothing has been run is
overridden by a narrow pattern (`NOT_RUN`), and the integrator is told so.
A sequential goal that wrote files and ends unmerged with nothing pushed is
parked by one more integrator call: its paths go to a local
`wip/grind-<goal>` branch and the checkout returns to a detached
`origin/<base>`. A goal whose dependency settled unmerged is blocked right
after planning.

**Rationale:** The workflow has no shell, and the integrator is the only
role allowed to change git state, so parking is an integrator prompt under
the build lock rather than a new role. A park branch rather than a stash
keeps the work visible and away from the shared stash stack, and switching
to a detached `origin/<base>` instead of `git reset --hard` cannot destroy
the user's carried changes. The override accepts a small risk that a real
rejection mentioning unrun checks is integrated; the integrator still runs
every check and is told to refuse a real defect, so a wrong change fails
verification rather than landing silently.

**Consequences:** A goal that pushed a PR which then did not merge is not
parked: its work is on the pushed branch. Park branches are local and never
deleted by Finish. If a park leaves the checkout dirty, every later goal in
the run is blocked. The contract is owned by
[architecture/grind.md](architecture/grind.md#review-gate-parking-and-dependents-1424).

## DD-100: The /grind router starts grind-run once per stage

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1409, spec #1392 §3. The feature branch must be cut from
`<main>` after the bug stage has merged, so it contains those fixes. Only
the router (the main session) may create the feature worktree, and a
Workflow call is one tool call: the router cannot act between two stages of
the same call. Cutting the branch before the call breaks that ordering.

**Decision:** The router starts `grind-run` twice. The bug-stage call gets
the plan and the bug children; its prework posts the plan and the result
returns `plan_url`. After the router cuts the feature branch and opens the
draft feature PR, the feature-stage call gets the feature children, the
feature branch as `base`, `plan_url` (so prework is not repeated), `feature`,
`feature_merge` and `stuck_bugs`, the bug children that did not merge.

**Rationale:** Each call keeps the workflow deterministic and needs no role
with the router's worktree rights. The stuck-bug rule stays in the workflow,
not the router's prose, because `stuck_bugs` carries the only fact it needs
across calls.

**Consequences:** An all-feature plan still makes a bug-stage call with no
goals, so the plan is recorded before any branch exists. `grind-run` still
orders stages when one call is given goals from both. The contract is owned
by [architecture/grind.md](architecture/grind.md#bug-stage-then-feature-stage).

## DD-101: /grind's preflight never touches its own files, and "carry" becomes the feature branch's first commit

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1407, spec #1392 §2. The router writes `.clud/grind/run.json`
before preflight (the plan-only pass needs it), and the feature worktree
lives under `.clud/grind/worktrees/`. In a repo that does not ignore
`.clud/`, a plain `git status --porcelain` reports the run's own files as
user changes, and `git stash push -u` would stash `run.json` away, taking
the hook's role caps with it. The spec's "carry into the grind worktree"
option also left open what happens to changes that are carried.

**Decision:** Every preflight command (`git status --porcelain -uall`, the
stash, the WIP commit) takes the pathspec `. ':(exclude).clud/grind'`.
"Carry" stashes the changes as `grind-<run-id>-carry`, and the feature setup
pops that stash in the feature worktree and commits it as the feature
branch's first commit.

**Rationale:**
- A pathspec needs no write to `.gitignore` or `.git/info/exclude`, so Abort
  still leaves the repo exactly as it was.
- `-uall` lists untracked files one by one, so the exclusion applies to each
  file rather than to a collapsed `?? .clud/` directory entry.
- Uncommitted changes in the feature worktree would be invisible to
  parallel goal worktrees (branched from the pushed feature branch) and would
  leak into whichever goal commit ran first in sequential mode. A commit
  makes them part of the feature that every goal builds on, and the feature
  PR shows them to the user.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| Add `.clud/grind/` to `.git/info/exclude` | A lasting side effect of a run the user may abort. |
| Carry the changes uncommitted | Goals would not see them, or would commit them by accident. |

**Consequences:** Carried changes reach `origin` on the feature branch, so
"carry" is only offered when the plan has a feature stage. Finish has nothing
to restore for a carry. The contract is owned by
[architecture/grind.md](architecture/grind.md#preflight-and-the-single-question-round).

## DD-102: The /grind plan comment body is shell-inert and piped from `printf`

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1408. `grind-prework` may not write files, so it must pass the
plan body to `gh issue comment` through its shell. clud's command hook
checks every shell call: its removal checks read a backtick, `$(`, `<(` or
`>(` as a substitution even inside single quotes, and its rm-identity check
parses each line of a heredoc body as a command. A plan in a backtick fence
passed with `--body '...'`, or any JSON body in a heredoc, is refused. A
60,000-character `--body` argument also overflows the Windows command-line
limit.

**Decision:** The workflow builds bodies that are inert in a single-quoted
shell word: a `~~~json` fence, and backticks, single quotes, `$`, `<` and
`>` inside the JSON written as `\u` escapes. Prework posts each body with
`printf '%s' '<body>' | gh issue comment <meta> --body-file -`, and its caps
allow exactly that `printf` form.

**Rationale:** Escaping in the workflow keeps the fix in one place and
leaves the hook's fail-closed parsing untouched. The JSON still parses to
the same plan, and a tilde fence renders like a backtick fence. Stdin has
no argument-length limit on any platform.

**Consequences:** Plan readers must parse the JSON rather than grep it for
raw characters. The contract is owned by
[architecture/grind.md](architecture/grind.md#prework-and-the-plan-comment).

## DD-103: /grind run facts are keyed by session id and live under `~/.clud/tmp/grind/`

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1337. The router kept its run facts in one fixed file,
`<repo>/.clud/grind/run.json`, and the command hook found it by walking up
from the tool call's cwd. Two `/grind` runs in one repo overwrote each
other's `mode` and `ci`, one run's Finish deleted the facts the other was
still using, and a crashed run's file was silently inherited by the next.

**Decision:** Each run's facts live in `~/.clud/tmp/grind/<session_id>.json`.
The router gets the path from `clud grind-facts path` (Claude Code exports
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` to every shell command) and removes only its own
file with `clud grind-facts clear`. The hook reads the file named by the
`session_id` in each PreToolUse payload; a missing, unreadable or
older-than-72-hours file gives the strictest caps (sequential, no CI) and a
hook-log line saying why.

**Rationale:** The harness showed that a workflow agent's PreToolUse
payload carries its parent session's id, so the id identifies the run
exactly, with no walk and no guessing, where a numbered slot (`run-NN.json`)
would still need a way to tell the hook which slot an agent belongs to.
Outside the working tree, the file cannot be staged or stashed by accident,
and the existing session-temp sweep removes what a crashed run leaves.

**Consequences:** The real-harness tests launch Claude Code with
`--session-id` so they can write facts up front, and a test that runs twice
starts a new session for its second run. Run facts are no longer visible in
the checkout; `clud grind-facts path` names the file. The contract is owned
by [architecture/grind.md](architecture/grind.md#router-questions).

## DD-104: Agents delete through rm-file / rm-dir, which trash by default, and agent-typed rm is redirected

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1340, meta #1436. Three layers intercepted deletion after the
#1064 incident (`rm -rf "$SP"/` with `$SP` unset): the child `rm` shim, which
refused every real `rm` without a CI variable and Docker; the rm identity
check, which failed closed on shell syntax it could not parse; and Claude
Code's own `rm` prompt, which can stall an unattended run. Across 2,710
`rm`/`rmdir`/`unlink` Bash calls they refused 62, including harmless ones. A
blocked agent then used `os.remove`, `shutil.rmtree` or `find -delete`, which
pass no check at all.

**Decision:** Agents delete through `rm-file` / `rm-dir`, argv[0] aliases of
`clud-shim` installed next to the session's `rm` shim. They move paths to
`~/.clud/trash` by default (`--purge` deletes), only inside the session's
roots (`CLUD_RM_ROOTS`: the launch checkout, its worktrees and
`~/.clud/tmp`), and write one audit record per call. The PreToolUse hook
refuses an agent's own `rm`, `rmdir`, `unlink`, `find -delete` and
`find -exec rm` with the exact replacement, and allows a command made only of
the tools, so Claude Code never prompts for it. A script's `rm` is allowed by
the child shim inside the roots. The `/grind` caps narrow the roots per role.

**Rationale:**

- **Trash by default.** The failure being prevented, deleting the wrong
  thing, is recoverable only if the delete is. A rename into the trash costs
  no more than a delete on the same filesystem, and 72 hours matches every
  other temp policy here. `--purge` stays one flag away, because scripts and
  large build trees sometimes need a real delete.
- **Redirect rather than check.** Proving an arbitrary `rm` command line safe
  from its text is the job the identity and rm-variable checks did, and every
  false positive they produced blocked real work. A command whose semantics
  clud owns needs no proof: roots are checked after expansion, by the tool,
  on every path. The redirect names the replacement instead of applying it
  through `updatedInput`, so the agent learns the command and stops typing
  `rm`.
- **Roots over allowlists.** Where a session may delete is a property of the
  session, so clud sets it once in the environment. The hook can only narrow
  it per role (grind subagents share one session), never widen it.

**Consequences:** `git clean -f` and inline `python -c` / `node -e`
deletions stay allowed; they are sometimes needed, and redirecting them would
only move agents to the next workaround. A script's `find -delete` reaches no
shim, which is an accepted gap. The rm-variable rewrite (#963) now serves only
shell tools the redirect does not cover (PowerShell-labelled tools). The
contract is owned by [architecture/rm-tools.md](architecture/rm-tools.md).

## DD-105: VT output processing is enabled once at startup and never restored

**Status:** Accepted

**Context:** #1374, meta #1441. #1345 made the PTY session guard enable
`ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING` on stdout for the session and restore it
on drop. clud writes escape sequences outside that window too: colored
`[clud]` notices on stderr, the graphics header before the guard and its
restore after it, and relayed daemon output that starts before the attach
loop's guard. Those sequences rendered only when an inline selector had run
first, because `selector::run` called crossterm's `supports_ansi`. That call
enables VT processing once per process, behind a `Once`, and never undoes
it. So first-run and reconfiguration launches worked, and an ordinary
already-configured launch printed literal escapes.

**Decision:** `main` calls `console_setup::enable_console_vt_output()` before
it parses arguments. That call ORs VT processing into the stdout and stderr
console modes. Nothing restores them at exit. `selector::run` calls the same
function, not crossterm's `supports_ansi`. The PTY session guard keeps its
own scoped enable and restore.

**Rationale:**

- **One enable that no launch path can miss.** Scoping the enable to each
  path means finding every write that precedes or follows it, on every path,
  now and in future. One call in `main` covers them all.
- **No restore at exit.** clud writes escape sequences until it exits, and
  most exits go through `process::exit`, where no destructor runs. A restore
  would have to be the process's last write, and there is no such point.
  Leaving the bit set is also what crossterm already did on every launch
  that showed a selector.
- **Idempotent, not `Once`.** A `Once`-latched enable cannot recover when a
  child that shares the console clears the bit. The function checks the mode
  on each call, so the selector can re-assert it for the price of one
  `GetConsoleMode` call.

**Consequences:** After clud exits, the shell's console keeps VT processing
enabled, as it already did after any launch that showed a picker. A guard
test fails if `fn main` stops making the call, or if a selector module calls
crossterm's `supports_ansi` again. The contract is owned by
[architecture/windows-quirks.md](architecture/windows-quirks.md#c-enable_virtual_terminal_input-raii).

## DD-106: Separate agent deletion from the child-process catastrophe floor

**Status:** Accepted; supersedes the deletion architecture in DD-104.

**Context:** #1461. The earlier in-roots child shim prevented legitimate
installers, including Codex's in-app update, from cleaning their own files
outside a checkout. The older agent aliases and hook refusals also led to
avoidable permission prompts and duplicate command policy.

**Decision:** Agents use one recoverable command, `safe-rm`, restricted by the
active profile's allowed locations. The command-scan hook rewrites recognized
direct deletion to it, refuses ambiguous or privileged forms, and leaves
quoted data alone. The deletion rule table supplies the aliases, redirect
mapping, Claude deny rules, and agent instructions. Claude receives a deny-list
backstop; Codex receives a trusted PreToolUse hook through launch arguments.
User configuration is merged, not overwritten.

Human-authored child scripts keep an `rm` PATH shim, but that shim enforces only
a catastrophe floor: roots, top-level directories, HOME, whole-home globs and
mounts are refused before any operand is handed off. All other requests go to
the next real `rm` on PATH with platform mount-preservation arguments. No CI
or Docker gate is involved. Both launch routes use the same shim and audit.

**Consequences:** Agent deletion is recoverable and profile-scoped; script
deletion remains compatible with installers, including cleanup outside the
checkout. The child shim is not a full sandbox or an agent-policy enforcement
point. Real-mount and real-harness tests cover the boundary. The operational
contract lives in [rm-tools.md](architecture/rm-tools.md) and
[rm-protection.md](architecture/rm-protection.md).

## DD-107: The Kitty top-right surface is a transient CPU HUD, not a second usage meter

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** #1359. The persistent token/cache strip added in #1238 repeats
the exact accounting already carried by the status line, while its one-row
text and hover-expanded details are hard to read. The CPU banner already
publishes a keyed, transient toast with the process-tree load and recovery
state, so the top-right image surface has a more useful signal to show.

**Decision:** The Kitty compositor renders the `cpu` event in its own
two-row, non-dismissible image and keeps the highest-priority non-CPU toast
independent below it. The panel is absent without a CPU event, appears at
90% opacity for two seconds, rests at 50% while the event remains, and
returns to 90% on hover when the child has already enabled SGR any-motion
reporting. Hover does not consume input, restart the clock, or extend the
event. clud does not enable mouse tracking itself. The existing banner
watcher owns sampling and lifetime; the compositor only renders its events.

**Consequences:** The writer needs a bounded wake even during a quiet TUI to
notice a new event, the opacity boundary, and expiry. CPU and ordinary
toasts need one atomic keyed hub snapshot, and an ordinary close click must
not dismiss the CPU event. Token counters stay in the status line; model and
cache health stay in the title fallback. The operational contract lives in
[architecture/toasts.md](architecture/toasts.md).

## DD-108: Installer entry precedes launch side effects and shares the selector

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** #1493. The installer must work without backend credentials or a
running daemon, and its first-run offer must never appear during utilities or
error paths. The established selector already owns raw terminal handling and
Windows ConPTY behavior.

**Decision:** Parse installer flags with the regular clap and known/unknown
splitter, then dispatch explicit requests immediately after argument
normalization. A bare interactive launch can offer installation if no `clud`
resolves by name on PATH; any other launch shape stays on the normal path.
Both entry points use selector models, with the automatic offer defaulting to
**Not now**. The selection is an install intent passed to a separate
transaction component.

**Consequences:** Installer entry cannot trigger the runtime-cache hop,
trampoline, title keeper, daemon, or backend preflight. The bounded offer gate
avoids prompting on invalid or utility launches. The detailed contract lives
in [architecture/native-installer.md](architecture/native-installer.md).

## DD-109: Self-install shares one consented binary transaction

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** #1494. Copying the running executable and installing a selected
release have different source checks but must obey the same destination,
consent, staging, and rollback rules. A successful absolute-path launch does
not establish that a new shell can resolve `clud` by name.

**Decision:** Build a read-only plan for either source and show its version,
source, digest, destination, replacement, and PATH proposal before any
installer-owned write. After consent, lock one approved user bin directory,
stage and validate one executable, preserve the prior bytes, then commit and
verify the final digest and version. Restrict release transfers to the exact
catalog URL and approved HTTPS asset redirects. Report binary commit as
pending until a separate activation step proves fresh name-based lookup.

**Consequences:** A declined plan changes no files. A transfer or verification
failure cannot replace the prior executable. Historical wheel assets need
bounded extraction of exactly one native binary. Recovery checks a prior
backup before another attempt. Windows replacement can fail when the old
executable is in use, and must preserve it in that case. The detailed flow
lives in [architecture/native-installer.md](architecture/native-installer.md).

## DD-110: Activation requires fresh name-based proof

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** #1495. A committed executable at an absolute path can still be
shadowed or absent from a new shell or Windows user environment. Startup files
and the Windows User Path may contain unrelated user settings that the
installer must preserve.

**Decision:** Include an activation plan in the pre-consent preview. On POSIX,
edit only marked owned stanzas in the active Bash or zsh login and interactive
files, or a fish `conf.d` snippet using non-universal `fish_add_path`. On
Windows, prepend only HKCU `Environment\\Path`, preserving its registry type
and raw variable references. Verify exact path and version from new shells or
an OS-built Windows User environment before reporting success. Roll back
owned activation edits when verification fails.

**Consequences:** Refusal changes no executable, profile, or registry value.
Unknown or shadowed lookup cannot be reported as installed. Machine Path
shadows on Windows require manual repair because User Path cannot outrank
them. The contract lives in
[architecture/native-installer.md](architecture/native-installer.md).

## DD-111: Pages downloads follow the verified stable catalog entry

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** #1496. GitHub's latest-release redirect can advance before all
native assets have been published and verified. Historical stable releases
can contain only wheels, which are not direct native downloads.

**Decision:** Render download links only for verified direct assets in the
catalog's `latest-stable` entry, using its exact immutable URLs and filenames.
Prefer static musl to GNU for each Linux architecture. Show an explicit
no-download message when that entry has no direct native assets. Verify the
generated page against the catalog and repeat the check on the public Pages
artifact after deployment.

**Consequences:** Pages may temporarily show no native downloads while a new
stable release is incomplete, and it never advertises a guessed installer
asset. Catalog promotion and page visibility remain separate checks in the
release flow.

## DD-112: PR installer acceptance runs the exact native candidate

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** #1497. An APE test can pass without executing the Rust binary
that a PR changes. Cross-built candidates also need proof that native-host
results came from the exact PR head and uploaded bytes.

**Decision:** Cross-build six dev-profile direct binaries from the PR head,
each with a provenance record. Bind their digests into a strict catalog
fixture, run each binary on its matching native host, and require six
successful records with fresh name-based version proof. Compare those host
records with the uploaded provenance in an always-run aggregate. Compile a
local fixture transport only in candidate builds so catalog selection,
digest verification, staging, rollback, and activation remain the production
paths. Keep APE checks for release workflow calls until the public release
gate replaces them.

**Consequences:** PR acceptance requires six native runners; a missing,
skipped, or failed cell blocks the aggregate. Fixture transport cannot be
used by release/default binaries. The prior-release wheel test verifies a
published digest before exercising selection through the candidate binary.

## DD-113: Clean NixOS and Linux distro lanes are required PR gates

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** #1498. A static ELF check and an Ubuntu install cannot establish
that a direct musl release works on clean NixOS or that shell activation works
across Linux distributions. NixOS 25.05 installs a stub ELF loader by default,
which can mask a missing GNU loader in a test VM.

**Decision:** Run pinned NixOS x64 and ARM64 VM tests on matching native hosted
runners, explicitly disabling the stub loader and `nix-ld`. Test the exact PR
candidate bytes with a fresh nonroot user, no ELF interpreter, selected
version and digest, name lookup, and rejection of a GNU-only historical
release. Run the same x64 musl bytes on Arch with fish, Fedora, and Alpine;
require every VM and distribution result in the installer aggregate.

**Consequences:** A skipped or failed VM or distribution blocks PR acceptance.
The ARM64 hosted VM has passed within the 30-minute job budget. Public HTTPS
candidate and stable gates will reuse these checks in the release flow.

## DD-114: Promote public native bytes only after a separate candidate catalog passes

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** #1499. A release built and tested privately can still differ from
the bytes served by GitHub. Publishing a new tag as stable before exercising
its public URLs would move normal installers to an unproven binary. Release
events created by `GITHUB_TOKEN` do not start a second workflow reliably.

**Decision:** Publish the final native assets under the final tag as a public
prerelease with `make_latest` disabled. Attach a versioned candidate catalog
that points to those exact assets but keeps `latest-stable` at the prior
release. Call the reusable six-host, NixOS, and distro matrix directly in
candidate mode. Require anonymous HTTPS catalog and asset downloads, exact
digest evidence, and fresh name-based activation. Publish PyPI only after
that gate, then promote the same GitHub asset IDs and deploy canonical Pages.
Call the same matrix again in released mode. On post-promotion failure,
demote the release, restore the previous latest release and Pages pointer,
and keep the workflow red. Serialize the release and both Pages publishers
with a shared non-canceling queue; recheck the prior public state before
promotion.

**Consequences:** A failed candidate gate leaves the previous stable pointer
and Pages untouched. A failed released gate triggers an explicit rollback
whose own failure remains visible. The compact APE stays in the first gated
release so its retirement can follow evidence from both public modes.
## DD-115: A resumable tool watchdog stop exits nonzero

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** #1431. `clud tool run` returned 0 after a resumable watchdog
stop even though the child had not completed. `pr_merge_watch` uses exit 0
as its green and mergeable verdict, so shell callers could merge while checks
were still pending.

**Decision:** Exit 0 means the tool process itself exited 0. Both command
and progress watchdog stops return 124. The existing terminal JSON distinguishes
`status: in-progress` (re-invoke with the same args) from `status: aborted`
(the process was killed). Pass the command cap to the child so
`pr_merge_watch` can clamp its own timeout below the cap and normally finish
with its own exit 4 and cancellation behavior.

**Consequences:** Callers must inspect 124 and the terminal JSON before
retrying; they cannot interpret a wrapper timeout as a successful verdict.

## DD-116: The session GitHub CLI alias upgrades PR-check watches

**Status:** Accepted (amends DD-065 and DD-094).

**Context:** The previous guard rejected the GitHub CLI's familiar PR-check
watch syntax and required agents to remember a separate clud command. That
kept waits fail-fast but made the supported path less discoverable.

**Decision:** Install a session-scoped `gh` alias using the existing
`clud-shim` binary. Resolve and pin the real executable before rewriting
PATH. Relay all ordinary calls unchanged; translate only the canonical
PR-check watch into the bundled fail-fast watcher. Resolve omitted, branch,
and URL selectors with the real executable, and reject incompatible or
unrecognized watch flags. The command guard permits this one watch only when
the alias is active. It continues to deny run-id watches and hand-written
polling; without the alias, it retains the prior denial.

**Consequences:** Agents can use familiar syntax without losing immediate
failure/review cancellation or the watcher's NO_CHECKS behavior. Existing
scripts that do not watch are unaffected. A missing or replaced target is a
visible error, never a recursive or native-watch fallback.

## DD-117: The per-turn-effort flip is a served section, and the injection is OpenRouter-descriptor-only

**Status:** Accepted. Ships dark: `per_turn_effort.enabled` is `false` until the
live endpoint check in #1528 is recorded.

**Context:** Claude Code keeps its prompt cache across a mid-session effort
change only when its client-side `per_turn_effort` capability is on for the
launched wire ID. On the direct `--openrouter` route clud is not in the request
path at all, so the only lever is the child environment:
`CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL_CAPABILITIES=<wire>=per_turn_effort`. OpenRouter publishes
the *gate* under its own name (`supported_parameters` carrying
`reasoning_effort`) but publishes nothing about per-turn *delivery*, and nobody
has yet recorded a live check that its `/api/v1/messages` endpoint accepts the
per-turn control **and** honors the level it carries.

**Decision:** Two separable pieces.

1. The gate is published, not curated: `ci/refresh_openrouter_catalog.py`
   derives `supports_reasoning_effort` from OpenRouter's `reasoning_effort`
   token and mirrors its `reasoning` object under OpenRouter's own names, so
   the artifact keeps one source of truth with the scheduled job.
2. Whether clud *acts* on that gate is a `per_turn_effort` section in
   `assets/server-settings.json`, read once per process and shipping
   `{ "enabled": false }`. The injection itself is gated on
   `descriptor.provider == OpenRouter` and uses `push_default`, so an ambient
   `CLAUDE_CODE_MODEL_CAPABILITIES` survives.

**Rationale:**
- The delivery claim is unverified, so the code must ship in a state that
  cannot act on it. A served section makes the flip land in ~20 minutes with no
  release, and makes the "not validated" state visible in one JSON key.
- Deriving the gate from the scheduled artifact means it tracks OpenRouter's
  inventory automatically; a hand-maintained list would drift within a day and
  could only ever cover wire IDs somebody had already validated by hand.
- The capability is a property of OpenRouter's Messages endpoint, not of the
  wire ID. Kimi and DeepSeek direct descriptors point at vendor endpoints that
  never see this message shape, and unified mode builds its own gateway env and
  never reaches `apply_anthropic_compat_overlay`. Naming the one provider in
  the gate keeps the claim where it was verified.
- The read is `catalog_cached_or_embedded()`, which never fetches: a launch
  must not pay egress or a delay for a capability the harness may ignore.

**Alternatives Considered:**

| Approach | Why not |
|---|---|
| A compiled-in constant | The claim is unverified; a constant would force a release to correct it, and a later `false` would be indistinguishable from an intentional revert. |
| A hand-curated `model_capabilities` section (the first draft of #1528) | Hand-maintained, one wire ID at a time, and duplicate of what the scheduled job already publishes — it would drift against `assets/openrouter-catalog.json`. |
| Gate on every Anthropic-compat descriptor (Kimi, DeepSeek too) | The claim was verified against OpenRouter's Messages API only; vendor endpoints do not implement the message shape. |
| Enable on merge and rely on refusal recovery | A silently-ignored effort level returns `200`, so nothing would refuse; the failure mode is a wrong answer, not an error. |

**Consequences:** `supports_reasoning_effort` being `true` for a row is not
sufficient for the injection — the served flip must also be on. Flipping the
section is a deliberate, reviewable act that asserts the endpoint check has
been recorded, and the section's built-in value is pinned by a guard test so it
cannot turn on by accident.

## DD-118: Retire the separate APE installer after native public release validation

**Status:** Accepted.

**Context:** The native `clud` executable now installs itself. Release 2.8.20
published six native executables and passed the public candidate and released
installer aggregates on Windows x64/ARM64, macOS x64/ARM64, Linux x64/ARM64,
the tested Linux distributions, and both clean NixOS VMs. The released catalog
at `/install/manifest.json` names 2.8.20 as `latest-stable`. The evidence is
[auto-release run 36412101247](https://github.com/zackees/clud/actions/runs/36412101247)
(successful attempt 2). GitHub Pages deployment initially rejected the release
tag under the `github-pages` environment's main-only policy; the environment
now also allows version tags matching `*.*.*`, and the rerun passed.

**Decision:** Stop building, publishing, and advertising the separate APE
installer in future releases. Keep historical release assets untouched. The
versioned native executable and its verified catalog remain the installation
route, with the existing wheel and script distribution paths independent.

**Consequences:** The release workflow no longer requires an APE artifact or
APE acceptance lanes. Public native candidate and released checks remain
required before and after stable promotion. Historical APE assets stay on
their original releases for existing users.

---

## DD-119: Every clud-shim alias fails open outside a valid session, through one dispatch path

**Status:** Accepted (amends DD-116's missing-target consequence).

**Context:** #1546. The alias directories are per user and shared by every
live session of every installed clud version. clud 2.8.20 added a `gh` alias
to `~/.clud/state/rm-shim`. Sessions started by 2.8.14 had that directory on
PATH but no `CLUD_GH_SHIM_*` keys, so their `gh` exited 127. That broke
`git`'s `!gh auth git-credential` helper, and pushes fell back to a desktop
askpass dialog. Each shim had decided its own out-of-session behavior:
`gh` and `python` failed closed, and `rm` ran its floor regardless.

**Decision:** One registry (`shim_registry::SHIMS`) lists every alias, and
the binary has one dispatch path. That path alone detects the session,
resolves targets, and passes through to the next real binary on PATH when
the session is missing or stale. Handlers get a validated session. A
`CLUD_SHIM_ABI` stamp marks the env a clud version built; any other value
passes through. The `rm` floor is session-only by owner decision. The child
env also sets `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` and, when the caller chose none, an
empty `GIT_ASKPASS`.

**Rationale:** Outside a session, the alias shadowing a real binary is the
bug, so matching that binary is the only safe default. A versioned or
content-addressed alias directory would also isolate versions. But the
aliases are about 30 MB each, and every rebuild would leave a new directory
that no process could safely delete while a session used it. The stamp gets
the same isolation at no disk cost. An empty `GIT_ASKPASS` stops git from
falling back to `SSH_ASKPASS` without disabling ssh's own use of it.

**Consequences:** A new alias is one registry row plus one handler arm. A
guard test refuses session keys, `exit` or `127` in handlers, and hardcoded
alias names in dispatch or the installers. An env built by an older clud
loses in-session behavior, including the `rm` floor, instead of failing.
Tests that exercise in-session behavior must stamp a session
(`tests/shim_env.py`). The daemon-socket interpreter protocol, stubbed since
slice 1 of #406, is removed. See
[architecture/shim-dispatch.md](architecture/shim-dispatch.md).

## DD-120: soldr follows rolling latest everywhere, superseding DD-020

**Context:** DD-020 pinned soldr exactly in the build backend, CI's
`setup-soldr` steps and `./install`. The pin then fossilized: clud sat on
soldr 0.8.44, whose catalogue client requested the retired
`catalogue.v1.json` endpoint, so the GNU and Apple preparation lanes failed
even though the live v2 catalogue carried their assets. Bumping to 0.9.9
exposed a compile-session relay bug fixed only in 0.9.10 — each fix arrived
by publication, and each pin had to be chased by hand (#1025, #1026).

**Decision:** Follow the latest soldr release everywhere (commit 856b24c2):
`pyproject.toml` requires plain `soldr`, `setup-soldr` steps pass no
`version:`, `./install` defaults to `latest` (resolved via the
`releases/latest` redirect), and the bundled Docker helper uses
`ARG SOLDR_VERSION=latest`, still asserted by a literal in
`crates/clud-bin/src/tools.rs`.
`test_packaging_metadata.py::test_soldr_release_policy_moves_in_lockstep`
now asserts every path is rolling, so no single path can drift back onto an
old protocol.

**Consequences:** DD-020's risk returns — a broken soldr release can redden
`main` without a clud change — traded for never running a stale soldr against
a moving catalogue. Every `setup-soldr` job resolves "latest" with a GitHub
API release lookup; anonymous local `act` runs share the 60 req/hr limit and
can hit 403 until it resets.

## DD-121: helper executables are argv[0] aliases of the one clud binary

**Context:** The wheel shipped four Rust executables — `clud`, `clud-shim`,
`clud-block-bad-cmd` and `clud-cmd-scan` — each linked separately and
statically carrying its own copy of the dependency tree (about 14 MB of
duplication, three extra link steps per build). The last two were the same
one-line program (`block_bad_cmd::run()`); `clud-shim` already dispatched on
argv[0]. Each extra file was another way to break a release: #1544 (binaries
shipped non-executable) and #862 (the Windows wheel missing `clud-cmd-scan`).
#406 kept the shim separate because a 30 MB image seemed too slow to start;
measured on Linux it costs about 0.5 ms (3.3 ms vs 2.8 ms) provided dispatch
runs before any startup work. No DD recorded the split.

**Decision:** `clud` is multicall and the only executable clud ships
(#1551). `multicall::maybe_run` runs first in `main`, before the console,
clap, tracing or the runtime, and keys on **argv[0]**, never `current_exe()`
(which resolves a symlink to `clud` on Linux, and on Windows argv[0] is
whatever the caller typed). Matching is case-insensitive, `.exe`-insensitive
and separator-agnostic:

| argv[0] stem | entry point |
| --- | --- |
| `clud-cmd-scan`, `clud-block-bad-cmd` | `block_bad_cmd::run` |
| `clud-shim`, `python`, `python3`, `gh`, `rm`, `safe-rm` (`shim_registry::SHIMS`) | `shim_main::run` | <!-- python-name-lint: allow -->
| anything else | the normal CLI |

`clud __cmd-scan [args]`, `clud __shim <name> [args]` and
`clud __link-aliases <dir>` reach the same entry points without an alias, for
hook configs, packaging smoke tests and test harnesses. They are handled
before clap, so they are not `Command` variants and need no registry entry.

Aliases are created at launch by `alias_link::install_alias`, in one fixed
order on every OS: **hardlink**, then **symlink**, then **copy**. Each is
staged under a unique name and renamed over the target. A failed hardlink
(`EXDEV`, FAT, network share) or symlink (Windows without Developer Mode) is
a fallback, never an error; only a failed copy is one, so a launch never fails
because a link could not be made. Aliases live in clud-owned directories under
`~/.clud/state/` (`shims`, `rm-shim`, `helper-bin`), never in the pip scripts
dir, which is not reliably writable (system Python, Nix, a root-owned install).
An alias is *fresh* when it is the same file as `clud`, a symlink resolving to
it, or a copy with its size and mtime; an upgrade replaces `clud`, so every
hardlink and copy goes stale together and the next launch relinks it.

The wheel's `REQUIRED_SCRIPTS` is `("clud",)`. `tests/test_build_wheel.py`
fails if `Cargo.toml` gains a second shipped `[[bin]]` or a wheel carries a
second script (the `clud-webterm` GUI companion on Windows and macOS is built
outside this workspace and exempt). A new helper gets a dispatch name, not a
binary.

**Amends DD-074:** the packaged shim identity is now `clud` itself, and any
file that is a hardlink of `clud` named `rm` is trusted — equivalent to the
old byte copy. One consequence: writing *through* a hardlinked alias modifies
`clud`, where a copy would have been isolated. Anything that can write the
alias directory can already write the user's `clud`, so this widens no trust
boundary, but tools must replace an alias (unlink then create), as
`alias_link` does, rather than write it in place.

**Supersedes** the #412 and #532 `Cargo.toml` rationale for separate
binaries. `clud-block-bad-cmd` remains a recognized name so a hook config the
rollout has not rewritten yet keeps working; `block_bad_cmd_rollout.rs`
still rewrites it to the bare `clud-cmd-scan`, which resolves through the
helper-only directory the launcher appends to PATH.

**Consequences:** Every `python`, `rm` and `gh` call in a session maps the
`clud` image instead of a 2.8 MB shim (no extra disk with hardlinks; a copy
fallback costs the full size per alias). Windows cold start of a 30 MB PE
under Defender is not yet measured; `ci-windows` must record it. On Windows
a hardlink keeps `clud.exe`'s data alive and locked while an alias runs, so
the self-install transaction (DD-109) relinks after replacing it.

## DD-122: worktree "landed" verdicts need PR or patch evidence, not ancestry

**Context:** #1591. This repo squash-merges. The squash commit on the default
branch is new, so a merged branch's tip is an ancestor of nothing there:
`git branch --merged`, `merge-base --is-ancestor` and `--clean-worktrees`'
`unpushed`/`no-upstream` states all report a landed branch as live work
forever, and sibling worktrees accumulate.

**Decision:** A worktree is judged landed only on positive evidence: a
merged PR whose `headRefOid` is the local tip or has it as an ancestor, or,
when there is no PR or no `gh`, the branch's cumulative diff since its
merge-base appearing verbatim (blob ids and hunk positions stripped, `-U0`)
as one default-branch commit. A `... (#N)` subject line is not evidence on
its own. Every doubt spares: a failed query, unknown coverage, an open PR
with the same head name, commits after the merged head, a branch with no
commits of its own, a lock without a pid. The decision is a pure function
over injected facts (`repo_worktree_verdict`), matching the reap/spare rule.

**Why not patch ids per commit (`git cherry`):** a multi-commit branch
squashes into one commit whose patch matches none of the originals.
Comparing the cumulative diff covers both shapes. Context lines are dropped
because the squash commit's parent can differ from the merge-base when
unrelated work landed in between.

**Consequences:** Reclaiming needs a network `gh` call per repo per tick, or
falls back to a diff comparison bounded to 100 default-branch commits. A
branch squash-merged with conflict edits matches neither signal without
`gh`, and stays pinned as `unverifiable`: the cost is disk, never work.
The first PR only surfaces verdicts in `clud gc list`; deletion lands
separately.

## DD-123: repo-worktree reclaim re-verifies from scratch and never forces

**Context:** #1603, the deletion half of #1591. The DD-122 verdict is
computed on a probe thread up to one tick before anything acts on it, and a
developer can return to a worktree at any moment in between.

**Decision:** The tick only *selects* from the cached snapshot. The purge
pool re-probes the one worktree immediately before deleting (fresh git,
fresh `gh`, fresh process table) and deletes only if the verdict is still
`reclaimable` with the same branch and tip. Removal is `git worktree remove`
without `--force`, so git's own clean check is a second, independent guard;
a failure is logged and never escalated to force. `git branch -D` runs only
while the branch still points at the verified tip. Remote branch deletion is
opt-in (`gc.delete_remote_branches`) and leased on the verified tip. A
process whose cwd is inside the worktree pins it, from a whole-process-table
snapshot; if the daemon cannot read even its own cwd, nothing is reclaimed.

**Why not delete straight from the snapshot:** that re-creates the #946
hazard: an hour-old "clean" verdict authorizing deletion of fresh work.
**Why not `--force` after re-verification:** re-verification and removal
are still two steps; without force git closes the remaining window itself.

**Consequences:** A worktree is removed at the earliest one tick after it is
first seen landed. Locked worktrees (dead pid), worktrees with submodules and
half-removed trees are left on disk and logged each tick: the cost is disk,
never work. `CLUD_GC_REPO_WORKTREES=observe` shows what would go without
deleting anything.

## DD-124: agent worktrees live in a sibling of the session temp root and are never on its timer

**Context:** #1485. Agent worktrees scattered next to their repos
(`~/dev/<repo>-wt-<n>`) with nothing reclaiming them. The first draft put
them under `~/.clud/tmp/wt` and let the `session_tmp` 72 h mtime sweep age
them out.

**Decision:** New agent worktrees go to `~/.clud/tmp-wt/<repo>-wt-<suffix>`,
a sibling of `~/.clud/tmp`, and are reclaimed only by the repo-worktree
verdict (DD-122/DD-123). The one time-based rule is `abandoned-empty`: a
clean, idle worktree under the root with zero commits ahead of the default
branch and no PR is reclaimable after a 24 h grace. Size only warns
(`worktrees.warn_bytes`).

**Why not the timer:** an old mtime is not evidence that a worktree's work
landed (an open PR can sit untouched for days), and in a squash-merging repo
neither is ancestry. Deleting on age risks unpushed commits; keeping on age
leaves merged clutter. Putting the root *outside* the sweep's scope, rather
than adding a skip-list entry inside it, means safety cannot regress the way
#1148's depth blind spot did. The grace rule is safe only for worktrees
holding nothing, and only under the clud-owned root: a user's hand-made
empty sibling worktree is never reclaimed for being empty.

**Consequences:** Unlanded work is kept indefinitely and surfaced as
`pinned` with a reason in `clud gc list`; the cost is disk, never work.

## DD-125: repo-worktree reclaims are serialized per repository by a lock on the pool thread

**Context:** #1632. The purge pool runs reclaims in parallel, so one tick
that reclaims two worktrees of the same repo ran two `git worktree remove` /
`branch -D` / `worktree prune` sequences against one git dir at once. They
contend on its `worktrees/`, refs and `.lock` files; on Windows one of them
intermittently died with exit 255.

**Decision:** `run_reclaim_serialized` holds a per-repo mutex, keyed by the
canonical repo root, for the whole reclaim, taken on the pool thread after
the job left the queue. The lock map's own mutex is held only to look up or
drop an entry, and a thread holds at most one repo lock, so there is no lock
ordering to get wrong. Entries are dropped when nothing references them.

**Why not group jobs per repo at dispatch:** the tick would have to batch
and hand a repo's whole list to one thread, changing the pool's one-job
contract and the per-row completion messages for no gain. **Why not one
global reclaim lock:** different repos share nothing, and a multi-GB
`worktree remove` in one repo should not stall another. **Why not retry on
failure:** a retry hides a race instead of removing it, and DD-123 already
leaves failures on disk rather than escalating.

**Consequences:** A pool thread can block behind another reclaim of the same
repo, bounded by that reclaim's git timeouts; other pool threads keep
draining the queue.

## DD-126: `model_contexts` publishes the default-routed endpoint's window, not the endpoint maximum

**Context:** #1634. OpenRouter's top-level `context_length` is the largest
window any endpoint of a model serves. `ci/refresh_model_contexts.py`
published it as-is, and clud passes it as `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS`.
clud sends OpenRouter no provider preferences (no `provider.order`, no
pinning), so a request goes wherever OpenRouter routes it. On 2026-09-30, 34
of 464 models advertised more than their `top_provider.context_length`:
`xiaomi/mimo-v2.6-flash` advertised 1,050,000 because one endpoint
(GMICloud) serves that, while the default-routed endpoints serve 1,048,576.
Claude Code then plans for tokens the serving endpoint rejects and fails near
the limit instead of compacting.

**Decision:** publish `min(context_length, top_provider.context_length)`.
When `top_provider.context_length` is `null` or absent (router rows such as
`openrouter/auto-beta`), keep `context_length`, so the row stays in the map.
A malformed `top_provider` fails the run like any other malformed field.

**Why not the minimum over `/endpoints`:** it needs one extra request per
model (~460 per run), and one small or newly added endpoint would shrink the
row for every user, so the published value would move with inventory rather
than with routing. **Why not pin routing:** pinning a provider trades
OpenRouter's fallbacks and price routing for a context number, a much larger
behavior change owned by provider selection, not by this map (DD-054).
**Why not a clud-side per-model override table:** the override already
exists. A catalog row's reviewed `claude_max_context_tokens` wins over the
served map, and an ambient `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` is never
overwritten. A third source would only add drift.

**Tradeoff:** a few models whose default endpoint is much smaller than their
largest one shrink a lot (`meta-llama/llama-4-scout` 1,310,720 to 327,680,
`qwen/qwen3.8-27b` 1,000,000 to 262,144). A prompt above the published value
could still be served by a larger endpoint, but clud cannot know it will be,
and overstating is the failure (hard error at the limit), while understating
only compacts earlier. This does not regress #1276: rows are never dropped,
and the MiMo rows lose 1,424 tokens and keep their ~1M window, far above
Claude Code's 200k unknown-model clamp.

**Consequences:** the value is still read from the one datasheet request, so
the refresh stays deterministic for a given payload. It follows OpenRouter's
choice of top provider, so a routing change upstream moves the row on the
next daily refresh.

## DD-127: Scheduled refresh bots gate their commit on the producer tests, not on a PR

**Context:** #1635. `refresh-model-contexts.yml` and
`refresh-openrouter-catalog.yml` commit their regenerated asset straight to
`main`. On 60f6087b a refresh landed a value that tests pinned, and `main` went
red with no PR to catch it (fixed by #1636).

**Decision:** each bot runs its producer's pytest file
(`tests/test_refresh_model_contexts.py`, `tests/test_refresh_openrouter_catalog.py`)
after the refresh and before the commit step. A failure fails the job, so
nothing is pushed. The step installs only `pytest`, `pytest-timeout` and
`running-process` (what `tests/conftest.py` and `pyproject.toml` need); it never
syncs the project. `tests/test_refresh_bot_gate.py` asserts the ordering.

**Why not have the bot open a PR:** a PR opened with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not
trigger `pull_request` workflows (GitHub's recursion guard), so `ci.yml` would
never run on it and the PR would sit ungated. Making it work needs a PAT or
GitHub App token, and the repository has no such secret (only
`DOCKER_PASSWORD`). Adding one is a credential decision for the owner. A PR
path would also turn a daily, unattended refresh into a daily merge chore.

**Why not run the Rust `server_settings::` tests in the bot:** that needs the
Rust toolchain and a clud build, minutes of work for a JSON rewrite. The
producers already enforce the bounds `ModelContexts::validate` checks
(server-settings.md, "Bounds"), and the pytest files check the rewrite touches
only its section and is idempotent on the committed document.

**Tradeoff:** the gate covers the Python-side invariants only. A Rust test that
pins a live value (the 60f6087b failure mode) can still go red after a refresh;
#1636 removed those pins, and a new one would be caught by the next CI run on
`main`, not before the push. `test_refresh_openrouter_catalog.py` tests the
producer's logic on fixtures, not the committed catalog itself. Revisit with a
PR-based flow if the owner adds a bot token.

## DD-128: safe-rm always allows entries under the system temp dirs, owned-by-you on Unix

**Context:** #1622. An agent wrote `/tmp/clud-issue-body.md`, then could not
remove it: `safe-rm` was the only deletion path and `/tmp` was outside the
session roots. Temp files are exactly what a delete guard should not block.

**Decision:** `/tmp`, `/var/tmp`, `$TMPDIR` (Unix) and `%TEMP%`/`%TMP%`
(Windows), canonicalized, are extra roots kept apart from `Roots::roots`
(`Roots::temp_roots`): entries strictly under them are deletable, the
directories themselves never. On Unix every existing entry from the temp root
down to the operand must be owned by the effective uid. See
[rm-tools.md](architecture/rm-tools.md#system-temp-directories-1622).

**Why an ownership check:** `/tmp` is shared. The sticky bit covers only
direct children of `/tmp`; a file inside another user's world-writable
directory is still unlinkable by the kernel, and a trash move takes it away
from them. Checking the uid is cheap and matches what an agent could
legitimately have created. **Why none on Windows:** `%TEMP%` lives in the
user's profile under a per-user ACL; there is no shared temp to protect.

**Why not simply add the temp dirs to `CLUD_RM_ROOTS`:** those roots have no
ownership rule, would be subject to grind-profile scoping and checkout
semantics (worktrees, clones), and the env var only exists in sessions; the
user-invoked `safe-rm` should behave the same.

**Tradeoff:** `$TMPDIR`/`%TEMP%` come from the environment. A value that is a
filesystem root, HOME or an ancestor is dropped, one inside HOME is dropped on
Unix (on Windows only `AppData\Local` is accepted), and the hook refuses a
deletion command that assigns them. A user whose `TMPDIR` is `~/tmp` does not
get that directory as a temp root; `/tmp` still works.


## DD-129: `--clean-worktrees` adds verdict-backed removals and does not lock against the daemon

**Context:** #1606. `--clean-worktrees` judged "landed" by ancestry, so a
squash-merged branch read as `unpushed`/`no-upstream` forever and was never
removed (DD-122), while the daemon, using `repo_worktree_verdict`, reclaimed
the same worktree. The two paths disagreed about the same fact.

**Decision:** the CLI runs the daemon's probe (`repo_worktree_probe`, through
`daemon::repo_worktree_cli`) and consults the verdict first. A `reclaimable`
verdict (merged PR covering the tip, patch match, abandoned-empty) makes the
worktree a candidate even when ancestry would skip or ignore it, and it is
removed by the daemon's executor (`run_reclaim_with`: fresh re-probe,
unchanged verdict, `git worktree remove` without `--force`, `branch -D` at the
verified tip, prune; never a remote delete). Any other verdict leaves the
ancestry decision exactly as it was, including `--force`, `--stale-after`
and the lock hard age; a skip gains `; verdict: <reason>` so `--dry-run`
shows the reason the real run acts on. A lock too fresh to pass the hard-age
gate still skips first, and a `dirty` ancestry status beats a stale
`reclaimable` verdict.

**Why additive, not a replacement:** the verdict pins things the CLI has
always removed on purpose (a stale clean worktree with no PR, anything under
`--force`). Replacing the rules would silently narrow a documented CLI.
Letting the verdict only add removals backed by positive evidence keeps every
existing spare and every existing removal.

**Why no cross-process lock with a running daemon:** the #1632 lock (DD-125)
is an in-process mutex for pool threads. The CLI already re-probes each
worktree immediately before removing it, so a worktree the daemon reclaimed
first comes back `gone from git worktree list` and is reported as skipped,
not failed; a truly simultaneous git step contends on git's own `.lock` files
and fails cleanly, and neither side forces. A file lock shared with the
daemon would add a new cross-process protocol to prevent an outcome that is
already harmless. Tested by
`a_worktree_reclaimed_by_someone_else_after_planning_is_skipped`.

**Consequences:** `--clean-worktrees` now also runs `gh pr list` once per
repo (bounded, `None` on any failure) and one probe pass; with `gh`
unavailable the patch-match fallback still finds squash merges.

## DD-130: `--clean-worktrees` bounds the verdict phase with one deadline and abandons a late probe

**Context:** #1648. DD-129 made `--clean-worktrees` (and its `--dry-run`)
run the daemon's probe unconditionally: a whole-process-table cwd snapshot,
a `gh pr list` with the daemon's 20 s timeout, and 5 s-per-call git probes
for every worktree. None of it had a total bound, so on a native Windows
runner the CLI smoke test's 10 s budget ran out.

**Decision:** the verdict phase runs on a worker thread and the CLI waits
for it at most 4 s in total (`VERDICT_DEADLINE`). Rows stream back per
worktree, so every verdict that arrived in time is used; the rest keep the
pre-#1606 ancestry decision, labelled `verdict timed out`. A repo with only
its main checkout skips the phase. `gh` gets 3 s and runs only if a
worktree reaches the PR check; the process table is read once per run.

**Why abandon the worker instead of cancelling it:** a blocking
`sysinfo` refresh cannot be interrupted, and the probe only reads. The
worker exits with the process. A real run acts only on verdicts that
arrived before the deadline, and the reclaim executor re-probes each one
before removing anything (DD-129).

**Why fall back to ancestry rather than skipping everything:** that is what
the CLI did before #1606, and the verdict only ever added removals. With no
verdict nothing is added, so spare on doubt holds. The reason is shown so
the user can tell a slow probe from a real spare.

## DD-131: the git / gh telemetry shim waits for the child instead of exec'ing

**Context:** #1486, as the user narrowed it: the session `git` and `gh`
aliases pass every call through unchanged and exist to gather telemetry. The
other relays (`python`, the old `gh` relay) `exec` the real binary, which
leaves nothing behind to record the exit code or the duration.

**Decision:** In a session, `git` and `gh` spawn the real binary with
inherited stdio, wait, append one JSON line, and return the child's code
(`shim_main::run_child`). On Unix they behave like a shell running one
command: they ignore SIGINT/SIGQUIT while the child runs, forward
SIGTERM/SIGHUP to it, and, if the child dies by a signal, record `128 + N`
and then re-raise N so the caller sees the same wait status. The log is a
local capped JSONL file (`<state>/logs/shim/git-gh.jsonl`, rotated at 8 MiB),
and every write error is ignored.

**Why not `exec` and log up front:** a start-only record has no exit code
and no duration, which are the useful half of the telemetry. **Why not the
daemon's HTTP telemetry:** a network hop on every `git status` adds latency
and a failure mode. **Why not refuse clones as first proposed:** Claude
Code's own worktree isolation, the grind skills and pip/uv all run `git
clone` / `git worktree add` through the same PATH, so a refusal would break
them (PR #1613 discussion).

**Consequences:** One extra process stays alive (the shim) for each git/gh
call in a session. Outside a session, and whenever the target is invalid, the
alias still `exec`s the next real binary with no telemetry.

## DD-132: there is no merge queue; the `ci-windows` rationale in DD-088 is corrected

**Context:** DD-088 called the `ci-windows` label safe "because the merge
queue always runs the full matrix". No merge queue was ever configured for
`main`: no ruleset, no branch protection, and zero `merge_group` runs as of
2026-09-30 (#1651). PR CI tests the head SHA, so `main`'s post-merge `push`
run is the only test the merged tree gets.

**Decision:** Docs and `ci.yml` comments describe that reality. The
`merge_group:` trigger stays, marked inert, so a future queue gets the `full`
tier with no workflow change. Enabling a queue, and deciding whether a
`ci-windows` PR must also pass the routine Linux lanes before merge, are
owner decisions recorded in
[ci.md](architecture/ci.md#what-protects-main-today).
`tests/test_ci_merge_queue_claims.py` fails if a queue claim returns.

**Consequences:** Until a queue exists, merging a `ci-windows` PR needs a
separate Linux run by convention, and a PR behind `main` merges an untested
tree.

## DD-133: `ci-windows` runs the routine Linux lanes on the same run

**Context:** With no merge queue (DD-132), `CI OK` in `windows` mode went
green with static + Windows x64 only, so a `ci-windows` PR could merge with
no Linux test of its head SHA (#1652). #1655 showed the mirror-image gap.

**Decision:** `windows` mode also runs every `minimal` lane (Dylint, Linux
clippy, build and unit shards) and `CI OK` requires `$MINIMAL $WINDOWS`.
Coverage comes from the same run, so it is deterministic and needs no API
lookup. A cross-run SHA lookup was rejected for its races with queued,
skipped or cancelled runs (#1639) and for failing `pr_merge_watch` early; a
Rust-only Linux subset was rejected because it drops pytest and clippy.

**Consequences:** Each `ci-windows` push costs ~10 extra Linux
runner-minutes, in parallel with the longer Windows lanes, so wall-clock
feedback is unchanged. Linux integration and macOS still need `ci-test` /
`ci-full`. `tests/test_ci_matrix.py` pins the gate. Details:
[ci.md](architecture/ci.md#ci-windows-keeps-the-routine-linux-lanes-1652-decided).

## DD-134: `/dev/shm` is a safe-rm temp root, and RAM-backed temp entries are purged, not trashed

**Context:** #1659. A sub-agent wrote 13 GB of benchmark output to
`/dev/shm/wild-review` (tmpfs, held in RAM). `safe-rm` refused it as outside
the roots, with or without `--purge`, so the data stayed in RAM until a human
removed it. DD-128 listed `/tmp`, `/var/tmp` and `$TMPDIR` but not `/dev/shm`;
that was an omission, not a decision.

**Decision:** `/dev/shm` joins the Unix temp-root candidates under exactly the
DD-128 rules: canonicalized, strictly under it only, the root itself refused,
symlinked parents judged by their target, every existing entry owned by the
effective uid. It is dropped where it does not exist (macOS). Separately, a
temp root on tmpfs or ramfs (Linux `statfs` magic; `Roots::ram_roots`) has
its entries **purged even without `--purge`**, after the usual GC audit line.
The outside-the-roots refusal now says `--purge` does not relax the check and
names the session temp dir as the place for scratch data.

**Why purge on tmpfs:** the trash is on disk under `~/.clud`. Trashing a RAM
tree is a cross-device copy: 13 GB written to disk and kept 72 hours, or a
failure halfway when the disk is smaller. tmpfs data does not survive a reboot
anyway, so the trash's recovery promise buys little. Refusing to trash with a
"pass `--purge`" message was rejected: it adds a round trip that every agent
would take, for the same end state. This applies to `/tmp` too when it is
tmpfs.

**Why not `/run/user/<uid>`:** it is per-user, but it holds live session
sockets and state (D-Bus, PipeWire, Wayland, systemd). Agents have no reason
to write scratch data there and every reason not to delete there. **Why not
a "`--purge` relaxes the roots" rule:** `--purge` chooses trash versus delete;
mixing in *where* would make the more destructive flag the less checked one.

**Consequences:** a POSIX shared-memory segment the user owns (for example a
running browser's) is deletable under `/dev/shm`, just as the user's own
sockets under `/tmp` are under DD-128. Ownership is the boundary in both. The
general case, data a session created anywhere else, is DD-135.

## DD-135: a creation ledger for safe-rm is hybrid, daemon-held, and written only by clud creating the path

**Context:** #1621 and the follow-up in #1659 ask whether `safe-rm` should
keep a per-file or per-directory record of what a session (and its
sub-agents) created, held in the clud daemon, so the session may delete its
own output outside the roots. No ledger exists today. `safe-rm` already talks
to the daemon (trash entries are inserted into the GC registry with
`gc_client_insert`), and Claude Code sub-agents run inside the parent's
process environment, so they share its `CLUD_RM_ROOTS` and session id: the
roots that refused `/dev/shm/wild-review` were the sub-agent's roots too.

**Decision (design; built in follow-up slices, not in the #1659 PR):**

- **Granularity: hybrid.** A *directory* is recorded when clud created it;
  everything under it is then deletable. A *file* is recorded only when clud
  created it inside a directory it did not create; only that file is
  deletable. A pre-existing directory is never ledger-eligible as a whole.
  Pure per-file was rejected because a build or benchmark writes hundreds of
  thousands of files through child processes nobody observes; pure
  "directories touched" was rejected because one write into `~/Documents`
  would make its siblings deletable.
- **Home: the daemon's GC registry**, as a new row kind keyed by session id,
  persisted in the registry's existing store, so it survives daemon and
  session restarts and compaction, and expires with the session's GC rows.
  Each row stores the canonical path, kind, session id, creator role, time,
  and on Unix device, inode and uid. `safe-rm` consults it only for a path
  outside the roots, after canonicalization, and requires the live
  device/inode to match, so a path swapped for a symlink or another file is
  refused. With the daemon unreachable, `safe-rm` falls back to today's strict
  roots and says so in the refusal; it never fails open.
- **Writers: clud must have created the path itself.** The daemon accepts a
  ledger insert only from a clud helper that performed the create (an
  exclusive `mkdir`/`O_EXCL` open, then insert with the resulting
  device/inode), never a "please record X" from an agent. That rules out
  self-declaration, which would let an agent ledger a pre-existing path and
  delete it. Rejected: filesystem watchers (fanotify needs privileges,
  inotify does not recurse cheaply, both see unrelated processes), and
  before/after snapshot diffs of every Bash call (cost proportional to the
  watched trees, and child-process noise).
- **Override:** a human-set, reasoned allowance (an extension of the roots,
  logged with its reason on every use) is the escape hatch for what the ledger
  cannot cover. An agent cannot set it.

**Why not in this release:** it needs a registry schema addition, a daemon op,
a new multicall helper name and agent guidance, each independently
reviewable. The common cases that motivated it (`/tmp`, `/dev/shm`, the
scratchpad) are covered by DD-128 and DD-134 now. Slices are tracked as
follow-up issues linked from #1621. Policy text:
[rm-tools.md](architecture/rm-tools.md#creation-ledger).

## DD-136: `safe-mktemp` is the only ledger writer, and undoes its `mkdir` when the insert fails

**Context:** DD-135 slice 2 (#1667) needs a clud helper that creates a
directory and records it, without ever giving an agent a way to record a path
clud did not create. Three choices were open: what to do when the daemon
insert fails, whether to create missing parents, and what to do on Windows,
where the ledger cannot verify identity.

**Decision:**

- **One writer, no record call.** `safe-mktemp` (a multicall name, DD-121) is
  the only caller of `gc_client_insert_created`, its writer trait is
  crate-internal, and it records only what its own exclusive `mkdir` just
  made. The identity comes from a handle opened `O_NOFOLLOW` on the new
  directory, checked to be an empty directory the caller owns at the path's
  current identity, never from a bare re-stat of the path.
- **Insert failure undoes the create.** If the daemon is unreachable or the
  insert fails, the helper removes the directory it made (non-recursively,
  only while it is still that empty directory) and exits 1. Rejected: leaving
  it and warning. An agent that reads only the exit code or the printed path
  would treat it as deletable scratch, then meet a refusal on cleanup and
  leave an orphan outside the roots.
- **No parents.** Parents are never created. A created parent would either
  be unrecorded (an orphan the session cannot remove) or recorded (widening
  the deletable area beyond what the caller asked for).
- **Windows fails before creating anything** (exit 2, a plain message), and
  the generated guidance omits the helper there. Creating a directory that
  `safe-rm` will refuse would pretend the ledger works.

Policy text: [rm-tools.md](architecture/rm-tools.md#creation-ledger).

## DD-137: the safe-rm root override is user-level only, and agents cannot write the settings file

**Context:** DD-135 slice 3 (#1668): a human-set, reasoned extension of the
safe-rm roots. clud reads settings from the user's `~/.clud/settings.json`
and, for some keys, a repo's `.clud/settings.json`. The override must be
something an agent cannot set for itself.

**Decision:** `safe_rm.extra_roots` (`[{path, reason}]`) is read only from
`~/.clud/settings.json`. An entry without a non-empty reason is dropped with
a message on every call. There is no environment-variable form. The
command-scan hook refuses any shell command that names that file or the key
unless it is a plain read, and the check runs before the per-call
`CLUD_ALLOW_ALL_CMDS=1` opt-out. Claude gets an `Edit(~/.clud/settings.json)`
deny for its file tools.

**Why not repo-level:** an agent edits files in its checkout all day; a repo
layer would let it widen its own deletion roots with one `Write`. **Why no env
form:** clud passes its environment to the agent, and the agent controls the
environment of the commands it runs, so an env override is agent-settable by
construction (the reason `CLUD_RM_ROOTS` assignments are refused). **Why deny
all file-tool edits of the settings file, not just the key:** a `Write`
replaces the whole file, so a key-level check would have to parse every
proposed content; the file is the user's configuration, and the `clud
settings` TUI remains the user's way to change it. **Why fail closed on
unknown programs:** a read-only allowlist cannot be bypassed by a writer the
list forgot.

**Consequences:** agents can no longer edit `~/.clud/settings.json` with
Claude's file tools or shell writers, for any key. The text scan cannot see a
path computed at run time, and Codex has no file-tool deny; the override's
own rules (strictly under, ownership, HOME rejected, reason logged) still bound
what a forged entry could reach. Policy text:
[rm-tools.md](architecture/rm-tools.md#override-safe_rmextra_roots-1668).

## DD-138: the first #1276 slice is a read-only transcript analyzer, not a repeated-call guard

**Context:** #1276: a direct `--openrouter` MiMo session lost its `/goal`
after "Autocompact is thrashing". Two capped responses (32,000 output tokens
each) emitted 294 and 371 identical Bash calls; their results refilled
context after each compaction. On the direct OpenRouter route clud only
overlays the child environment (`foreground_runtime.rs`,
`apply_anthropic_compat_overlay`): there is no clud bridge in the request
path, so compaction, the thrash detector and goal clearing all belong to the
harness. clud owns its hooks, its bundled guidance and tools, and offline
analysis.

**Decision:** ship `diagnostics/transcript_report.py` as a bundled tool
(`clud tool run diagnostics/transcript_report.py <transcript.jsonl>`). It
collapses transcript rows by `message.id` and counts each response's usage
once, reports bursts of identical tool calls inside one response (copies
and longest streak), compaction boundaries, context jumps, terminal context
errors and tool-result byte totals. A transcript does not record the child
environment, so the effective max-context value comes from clud's
launch-context record joined by hashed session id (#1675,
[DD-139](#dd-139-the-launch-context-record-is-bound-by-the-sessionstart-hook-and-keyed-by-a-domain-separated-session-hash)), and is
reported as unavailable when no record exists. Its
output holds counts, tool names, timestamps and fingerprints keyed with a
random per-run salt. It never prints prompts, commands, tool inputs or
output, or the session id. It writes no files.

**Why not the PreToolUse repeated-call guard first:** a guard runs on every
tool call of every session and needs cross-call state, and its threshold has
no measured baseline. Legitimate polling (`gh pr checks`, retry loops) repeats
identical calls, so a wrong threshold blocks real work. By the time a hook
sees the calls, the 32,000 output tokens are already spent. The analyzer is
read-only, testable offline and cannot break a session, and it produces the
baseline a guard's threshold needs. The guard is a tracked follow-up.

**Why not a `clud` subcommand:** a top-level subcommand costs four registry
places and a release for a diagnostic that one script handles. The
bundled-tool runner already gives it a watchdog and an installed path.

**Consequences:** the incident shape is now detectable from a transcript.
Nothing stops a live burst yet. The session ledger, the guard, bounded-output
guidance and the harness-owned goal recovery are separate #1276 follow-ups.

## DD-139: the launch-context record is bound by the SessionStart hook and keyed by a domain-separated session hash

**Context:** #1675 (parent #1276): nobody could tell which
`CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` a failing child inherited. The value is
decided at launch, but an interactive Claude launch does not know its session
id, and the transcript that names the session does not record the env.

**Decision:** the launch writes a pending record from the final child env and
hands its random token to the child; the `SessionStart` hook clud already
registers (`clud session-hook`) receives the session id and copies the record
to `<state>/launch-context/<hash>.json`. The hash is the first 16 hex chars of
`sha256("clud-launch-context-v1\0" + session_id)`. Records live under the
clud state dir and are pruned at write time to 14 days and 200 files. Contract:
[launch-plan.md](architecture/launch-plan.md#launch-context-record-1675).

**Why not pass `--session-id` at launch:** it changes the argv of every
interactive launch and conflicts with `--resume`/`--continue`; the hook
already runs on every Claude launch and costs nothing new.

**Why an unsalted hash:** the reader must find the record from the transcript
alone, so a per-run salt (as the analyzer uses for fingerprints) cannot work.
A session id is a random UUID, so a truncated SHA-256 of it cannot be
reversed; the domain prefix keeps it distinct from any other hash of the id.

**Why per-session files, not one JSONL:** the reader opens one known path
instead of scanning, a rewrite on `/clear` or resume replaces one file
atomically, and pruning is a single directory listing. 14 days covers the
window in which a failure is investigated; the 200-file cap bounds the
directory for heavy users.

**Consequences:** a session started outside clud, or whose hook did not run,
has no record and the analyzer still prints "unavailable". `harness_version`
stays `null` until it is known without a spawn.

## DD-140: the repeated-call guard denies call 201 of an identical streak and fails open

**Context:** #1674 (parent #1276, follow-up named in
[DD-138](#dd-138-the-first-1276-slice-is-a-read-only-transcript-analyzer-not-a-repeated-call-guard)).
One MiMo response emitted 294, then 371, identical Bash calls. The guard
needs a threshold, and a threshold set too low blocks legitimate polling.

**Evidence:** the bundled analyzer's call fingerprinting (tool name +
key-sorted input), run read-only over 3,539 local Claude Code transcripts
(215,077 tool calls; only counts were kept). Longest consecutive identical
streak per session: median 1, p99 6, and 3,249 of 3,393 sessions never
repeated a call. Inside a single response no legitimate transcript ever
repeated a call (max 1). Across responses the tail is long: sleep-paced
polls (`gh pr checks`, `sleep … &&` loops) reached 39, 48, 63 and 138; a
10-minute scheduled tick reached 50; three Claude sessions issued the same
call 297, 343 and 391 times at 2–4 s intervals without sleeping. The
incident streaks were 294 and 371 at sub-second intervals in one response.

**Decision:** `N = 200` consecutive identical calls are allowed per session;
call 201 and later are denied with a "stop repeating, decide afresh"
message. A gap over 120 s resets the streak. `CLUD_REPEAT_CALL_LIMIT` or
`hooks.repeat_call_limit` changes N, `0` disables the guard, and
`CLUD_ALLOW_REPEAT=1` in a command bypasses it for that call with an audit
line. Contract: [hook-dispatch.md](architecture/hook-dispatch.md#repeated-call-guard-1674).

**Why 200:** it is 45% above the longest observed sleep-paced poll (138) and
four times the scheduled-tick streak, so measured legitimate work is never
denied, while both incident streaks (294, 371) are cut by a third or more.
25, the issue's starting suggestion, would have denied the 39-, 48-, 63- and
138-call polls. The 297–391 un-slept loops would be denied; they are
treated as the same pathology (a model re-issuing a call without a new
decision), the deny message tells the model to sleep between polls, and the
override exists for the rare deliberate case.

**Why no response id or timing in the key:** the PreToolUse payload carries
no message id, and inter-call gaps overlap (incident median 0.44 s; fast
cross-response loops reached 0.74 s). The only time rule is the 120 s idle
reset, which no burst can meet and which keeps scheduled `/loop` ticks
unbounded.

**Why fail open:** the guard is a safety net against runaway loops, not a
security boundary. A state error that denied calls would break every tool
call of a session, which is worse than the loop it guards against.

**Consequences:** the guard sees calls only after the model emitted them, so
a burst's output tokens are still spent; it stops the results from refilling
context. Sessions without a `session_id` in the hook payload, and harnesses
that run no `PreToolUse` hook, are unguarded.

## DD-141: session temp size is reported, never a deletion trigger

**Context:** #1327 asked to "bound `~/.clud/tmp`" with a size cap on the
session-temp sweep. The tree that grows past any cap is, by construction,
mostly the live sessions' scratchpads, pytest `tmp_path` worlds and build
output: the data an agent is using right now. #1148 already declined to
reclaim oversized live session directories for the same reason.

**Decision:** `tmp.warn_bytes` (default 20 GiB, `0` disables) only warns, in
`clud gc list` and on the launch banner, using the cached walk of #1610
(`gc::worktree_size_cache`). The 72 h mtime sweep remains the only thing
that deletes session temp. Contract:
[gc-and-registry.md](architecture/gc-and-registry.md#filesystem-sweeps-non-registry).

**Why not evict oldest-first past the cap:** "oldest" by mtime under 72 h is
still possibly active (a long build writes into a directory created hours
ago), and a cap that fires mid-session deletes working data with no owner
consulted. A warning costs nothing and points the human at the culprit.

**Consequences:** `~/.clud/tmp` can still exceed the threshold for up to the
age-sweep window; the acceptance line "stays under a configured size" in
#1327 is met by visibility, not enforcement.

## DD-142: a session-tmp sweep pass always retires

**Context:** #1672: `~/.clud/tmp` reached 162 GB. The sweep was running, but its
pass had started 8 days earlier and never finished. 195 `Scan` items named
directories that had since vanished (`NotFound` was treated as an inconclusive
scan and retried), and 50 `Delete` items hit files owned by root from Docker
bind mounts (`EACCES`, retried). A new pass starts only when the queue is
empty, so 1084 of 1184 session directories went stale after the pass began
and were never evaluated.

**Decision:** a vanished candidate completes. An item that fails
`MAX_ITEM_RETRIES` (8) times in a row is dropped, and dropping it spares it.
The pass then retires, and the next one re-derives every candidate from the
filesystem. Read-only directories the user owns are made writable before a
retry, as safe-rm does (#1573).

**Why not keep retrying (the #1260 contract):** the queue is a cache of what
the filesystem says. Dropping an entry loses no information: the path is
still on disk and the next pass finds it again. Keeping the entry makes one
undeletable path block every other candidate on the machine.

**Consequences:** an undeletable tree is retried roughly once per pass
(every six hours) instead of continuously, and each give-up is logged with
its last error. Deletion rules are unchanged: only a fully scanned, idle,
rechecked tree is removed.

## DD-143: trash has a size cap, session temp does not

**Context:** #1672: `~/.clud/trash` held 87 GB on a disk that was 94 % full.
Almost all of it was inside the 72 h `safe-rm` restore window: agents had
deleted large `target/` trees in a burst, and retention was time-only.
DD-141 declined a size cap for `~/.clud/tmp`.

**Decision:** `trash.max_bytes` (default 20 GiB, `0` disables) evicts the
oldest trash entries first until the total fits. An entry trashed less than
an hour ago is never evicted. Only real directories directly inside the
canonical trash root are considered; symlinks are never followed. Each
removal is audited.

**Why trash and not tmp:** session temp is live working data with no owner
to ask (DD-141). Trash is data a user or agent already asked to delete.
Nothing reads it back except a human restoring by hand, so eviction only
shortens the restore window. The one-hour floor keeps an immediate "undo"
possible.

**Consequences:** under a burst larger than the cap, entries older than an
hour lose their restore window early. A user who wants the full 72 h can set
`trash.max_bytes` to `0`.

## DD-144: `~/.clud/cache` size is reported; clud does not run `uv cache prune`

**Context:** #1691: `~/.clud/cache` reached 31-33 GB, almost all uv's own
content-addressed cache (`archive-v0` 28 GB, `sdists-v9` 4.5 GB). The daily
uv sweep (#423) only ages out `environments-v2/` entries. The issue proposed
reporting the size and optionally running `uv cache prune` from that sweep.

**Decision:** `cache.warn_bytes` (default 20 GiB, `0` disables) only warns, in
`clud gc list` and on the launch banner, through the cached walk of DD-141
(`gc::worktree_size_cache`, cache file `~/.clud/cache-size.json`, a sibling of
`cache` so uv never sees it). clud does **not** invoke `uv cache prune`, and
its own walker never deletes inside uv's cache. The warning names the
upstream commands (`uv cache prune`, `clud gc purge --kind uv-cache --yes`)
for a human to run. Contract:
[gc-and-registry.md](architecture/gc-and-registry.md#filesystem-sweeps-non-registry).

**Why not an automatic prune (checked against docs.astral.sh/uv, cache
concept and CLI reference):**
- `uv cache prune` "removes all unused cache entries **and all centralized
  project environments**". `environments-v2/` is where `uv run --script`
  keeps every bundled-tool and hook env, so a daily prune would wipe envs
  clud's own 72 h sweep deliberately keeps, and every hook would re-resolve.
- The concurrency guarantee is a 5-minute wait for other uv processes, after
  which behaviour is not specified there, and `--force` removes locks held by
  others. It also depends on the user's uv version (clud runs whatever `uv`
  is on `PATH`), which clud cannot verify offline.
- "Unused" means unreachable from uv's own wheel index, not from any clud
  env, so the 28 GB of referenced `archive-v0` entries are likely not
  reclaimed at all; the cost is real and the benefit unproven.
- `--ci` drops all pre-built wheels: a forced re-download of everything.

**Consequences:** the cache can still grow; the banner makes it visible and
the human chooses when to prune. An opt-in prune can revisit this once its
reclaim on a real cache and its lock behaviour across supported uv versions
are measured.

## DD-145: the uv cache is capped by `uv cache clean`, never by deleting buckets

**Context:** #1691 reopened after DD-144: `~/.clud/cache/uv` held 33 GB
(`archive-v0` 28 GB, `sdists-v9` 4.5 GB). The growth is not bundled tools:
`main.rs` pins `UV_CACHE_DIR` for clud's whole process tree, so every `uv`
an agent runs in a user project fills this cache. On the reporting host,
22.5 GB of `archive-v0` was single-linked (only the cache held it) and
10 GB was hard-linked into live venvs, which deleting the cache would not
free and would not break.

**Decision:** `cache.max_bytes` (seeded 32 GiB, `0` disables). Once a day the
uv sweep (#423) measures the cache; above the cap it runs
`uv cache clean --cache-dir ~/.clud/cache/uv` (via `running-process`),
audited as `gc.uv-cache-cap`. The pure `gc::uv_cache::decide_cap` spares when
the cap is off, the root is not a real `uv` directory directly inside a
non-symlinked `~/.clud/cache`, the cache is under the cap, **any** process
named `uv` is running on the host, or `UV_LINK_MODE=symlink`. clud never
waits more than 15 minutes and never kills the uv it started.

**Why not the alternatives (checked against docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/cache):**
- Deleting `archive-v0`/`sdists-v9` by age: uv says "it's *never* safe to
  modify the cache directly (e.g., by removing a file or directory)". The
  bucket indexes would point at missing archives.
- `uv cache prune`: DD-144 still holds (drops centralized environments,
  "unused" relative to uv's index, so little reclaim).
- Splitting the cache per purpose: the bulk comes from user-project uv runs,
  which would then land in the user's `~/.cache/uv`, outside clud's control,
  and the bundled-tool slice is small. It moves the bytes, it does not bound them.
- `uv cache clean` is uv's own documented "removes all cache entries" and
  takes uv's cache lock itself, so clud deletes nothing inside the cache.

**Why on by default:** the cache is entirely re-derivable, and an unbounded
cache filled real disks. 32 GiB sits above `cache.warn_bytes` (20 GiB), so
the banner warns first. The cost is bandwidth: after a clean, the next
builds re-download only what they use (typically a few GB), once per
crossing. `environments-v2` script envs are rebuilt on next use. Symlink-mode
venvs would break, hence that spare. A user with metered bandwidth sets `0`.

**Consequences:** the cache is bounded to roughly `cache.max_bytes` plus one
day of growth, deferred while any uv runs at sweep time. A busy host that
always has some uv running is never cleaned; the warning still shows.

## DD-146: a force-killed session is restored by a guard process, not by a handler

**Status:** Superseded by [DD-147](#dd-147-ctrlc-restores-the-terminal-in-process-forced-kills-are-out-of-scope). The guard was removed; the body below is kept as history.

**Context:** #1705. `RawTerminalGuard::drop` restores the terminal on every
exit clud controls, but `kill -9`, the OOM killer, `taskkill /F` and
`TerminateProcess` run nothing in the process, and the child TUI dies with it.
The user's shell is left in raw mode with mouse tracking, focus reporting and
bracketed paste on (#1697's post-exit screenshot).

**Decision:** each raw-mode session starts `clud __term-guard`, a detached
process that shares the terminal. It learns the session's initial and raw
settings and its kitty frame count over an authenticated loopback socket. If
the socket ends without a `D`, it writes the reset and restores the
settings, but only while they still equal clud's raw settings.

**Why not the alternatives:**
- A signal handler or `atexit`: SIGKILL and `TerminateProcess` cannot be
  caught. Only another process survives them.
- The guard as a plain child: `taskkill /T`, a process-group kill and a Job
  Object close all reach direct descendants. The guard is launched through a
  launcher that exits immediately, as a `running-process` daemon (new session
  or process group, Job breakaway), so it is in none of those sets.
- An inherited pipe for liveness: `running-process`'s daemon spawn sanitizes
  every handle, by design. A loopback socket gives the same EOF-on-death and
  needs no file, so nothing is left behind to clean up.
- Polling clud's pid: it is slower and racy against PID reuse. Socket EOF
  arrives the moment the kernel closes clud's descriptors.
- Restoring the settings unconditionally: by the time the guard acts, the
  shell may already have set its own line-editor mode, and overwriting that
  would break the prompt. Restoring only on an exact match with clud's raw
  settings never undoes a shell's change.
- Popping a fixed number of kitty frames: a shell such as fish pushes its own
  frame at the prompt. The guard pops exactly the count clud last reported.

**Consequences:** each session spends two short process spawns, off the
startup path (spawn and accept run in the background). A
guard that never connects costs nothing: clud stops listening after 10 s. The
reset bytes can in principle land after a fast shell's prompt has enabled
bracketed paste; the guard acts on socket EOF, which comes before the shell
can observe the child's exit. `CLUD_TERM_GUARD=0` opts out.

## DD-147: Ctrl+C restores the terminal in-process; forced kills are out of scope

**Context:** DD-146's out-of-process guard covered `kill -9`, the OOM killer and
`TerminateProcess`, at the cost of two extra processes and a loopback protocol
per session, for a rare case. The common case was going wrong instead: Ctrl+C
ends a session by killing the child (`interrupt_pty_process`), so a TUI never
runs its own exit path, and clud's `Drop` reset turned off input modes but
left the alternate screen, scroll region, cursor-key and keypad modes, autowrap
and colours as the dead child set them.

**Decision:** keep Ctrl+C as an immediate kill and remove the guard. The
session's child-output tracker (`KeyboardEnhancementTracker`, fed on the local
pump and the daemon attach alike) also follows the modes the child turns on
(`session/child_modes.rs`). On the way out, the session turns off exactly those
that are still on, leaving the alternate screen first and saving the cursor
around the scroll-region reset. It then sends the blanket reset of modes that
are always off outside a session.

**Why not the alternatives:**
- A blanket reset of the stateful modes: `?1049l` on a terminal that was
  never on the alternate screen restores a stale saved cursor, and `CSI r`
  homes the cursor. These have to be conditional on what the child did.
- Letting the child exit gracefully on Ctrl+C: a behaviour change to Ctrl+C
  that was not wanted; the tracked reset makes the kill safe as it is.
- Keeping the guard: no in-process handler can observe a forced kill, so the
  guard was the only way to cover one. That coverage is given up deliberately.

**Consequences:** a forced kill can still leave the terminal in a bad state
(`reset` / `stty sane`, or a new tab on Windows). Every exit clud controls
(child exit, Ctrl+C, the termination signals, a panic) undoes what the child
left on.

## DD-148: a corrupt uv wheel entry is invalidated under uv's entry lock, not cleaned

**Context:** #1711. On 2026-09-22 an agent's disk cleanup ran
`find ~/.clud/cache/uv -type f -mtime +7 -atime +7 -delete`. That was before
#1484 refused `find -delete`. Package files are hard-linked into live venvs,
so imports kept their atime fresh, but `.dist-info` files are never read on
import. The `find` removed them and kept the code. `-type f` skips symlinks,
so 164 live wheel pointers kept pointing at gutted archives:
- 10 had no `.dist-info`, so every install of the pin failed with "The wheel
  is invalid: Missing .dist-info directory". `pydantic 2.13.4`,
  `cryptography 50.0.0` and `click 8.4.2` were among them.
- 40 had no `RECORD`.
- 114 were missing files that `RECORD` lists. These install and then fail on
  import.

This is the failure DD-145 predicts for age-based deletion. uv trusts any
pointer whose archive directory exists, so the damage was still breaking
installs nine days later.

**Decision:** the daily uv sweep and `clud gc prune --kind uv-cache` run
`gc::uv_cache_repair`, which proceeds as follows:
1. It walks the `wheels-v*` pointers: a `<key>` symlink with a `<key>.http`
   or `<key>.rev` sibling that resolves into `archive-v0/`.
2. It flags an archive with no top-level `.dist-info`, no `RECORD`, or a
   missing `RECORD`-listed file.
3. It takes a shared lock on `<root>/.lock` and then the exclusive
   `<key>.lock`, re-checks the link, and audits the change as
   `gc.uv-cache-repair`.
4. It unlinks only the pointer files.

uv then sees a cache miss, re-downloads into a fresh archive id and
republishes the pointer. The broken archive stays behind as a dangling entry
for `uv cache prune`. The pass is Unix-only in effect. On Windows uv writes
`<key>` as a plain link file rather than a symlink, and keys the entry lock by
the wheel stem, so the scan finds nothing there.

**Why not the alternatives:**
- `uv cache clean <pkg>`: it needs the cache's exclusive lock, and every live
  `uv run` holds the shared lock for its whole lifetime. That includes clud's
  own bundled tools, such as `pr_merge_watch.py --timeout 1700`. On the
  reporting host the clean waited 300 s and gave up, and that host always has
  some uv running.
- `uv cache clean --force <pkg>`: it skips the lock and deletes every version
  of the package plus its now-dangling archives. Concurrent installs may be
  hard-linking a healthy version from those archives.
- Deleting the broken archive: its files can be hard-linked into live venvs,
  and removing a dangling entry is what `uv cache prune` is for. DD-145 still
  holds: clud never deletes archive contents.
- A `uv_running` spare like the cap's: the busy host is exactly where the
  repair is needed. The per-entry lock is the concurrency control uv itself
  uses when it replaces that pointer, and a held lock skips the entry until
  the next pass.

**Consequences:** a gutted entry costs one re-download instead of a permanent
install failure for every session that shares the cache. A wheel whose
`RECORD` lists files it never shipped is re-fetched on each pass. That is
bounded and has not been observed: all 830 intact pointers on the reporting
host validate. Removing pointer files is a deliberate, narrow exception to
uv's "never modify the cache" guidance. It applies only to pointers whose
target is already unusable, and only under uv's own locks.

## DD-149: a configured soldr version is a minimum; a launch never downgrades soldr

**Context:** DD-014 made a numeric `rust.version` / `optimize.rust.soldr_version`
an exact pin. `soldr_activate` reconciled it on every launch: whenever the
installed version differed from the pin it ran
`uv tool install --force soldr==<pin>`. A repository that still carried an old
pin (`running-process` pins `0.7.11`) therefore downgraded the user's tool on
every `clud` launch in that checkout: the uv receipt was rewritten to
`==0.7.11` and `~/.local/bin/soldr` relinked, replacing a deliberately
installed 0.9.x. 0.7.11 has no `soldr prepare`, and a tool version that
differs from the running soldr broker fails every compile session ("broker
refused the daemon route: backend spawn failed"). The exact `==` receipt also
stopped a later `uv tool upgrade soldr` from ever moving forward.

**Decision:** the version setting is a floor. `soldr_action` decides:
soldr missing → install; installed and older than the minimum → upgrade;
equal, newer, or unreadable → leave it alone. The minimum is the configured
version raised to `MIN_SOLDR_SHIMS_VERSION` (clud needs `soldr shims`), and
installs use `soldr>=<minimum>`, so uv resolves the newest release and records
a floor in its receipt. The unpinned (rolling latest, DD-120) daily
`uv tool upgrade soldr` is unchanged; it only moves forward. clud bakes in no
blessed soldr version beyond the shims floor, per DD-120.

**Consequences:** a stale repo pin can no longer break a newer soldr; at worst
it is a no-op. A repo cannot hold contributors on an *older* soldr through
clud any more; doing that needs the repo's own toolchain pin, not clud's
launcher.

## DD-150: the session `gh` read broker reruns the real `gh` over a loopback replay

**Context:** #1743 routes in-session `gh api` GETs through a daemon cache so
agent sessions stop spending the shared REST budget on repeat reads. The
cache only helps if a brokered call prints exactly what the real `gh` would,
including `--jq`, `--template` and TTY pretty-printing. Reimplementing those
in clud (a jq engine, Go templates, gh's JSON colorizer) could only
approximate `gh`, and would drift with every `gh` release. The design also
named SQLite for the store, but clud replaced its bundled SQLite with redb
(#73/#110).

**Decision:**

- The shim never formats output. It reruns the caller's own argv on the real
  `gh`, with the endpoint replaced by a one-shot loopback URL that serves the
  brokered body and headers. `gh api` accepts an absolute URL, sends no
  token to a host it has none for, and Go never proxies loopback, so the
  output is `gh`'s own over the same bytes. Flags whose output would show the
  substitution (`-i`, `--verbose`), and anything the classifier does not
  know, pass through unbrokered. So do non-2xx responses, so error text stays
  `gh`'s.
- The broker fetches through the real `gh api -i` with the caller's
  forwarded auth env, never with a token of its own. The forwarded values are
  hashed into the cache key.
- The store is a daemon-owned redb file, `gh-broker.redb`, not SQLite.
- Phase 1 caches every object under a TTL, completed runs included, and
  invalidates the whole cache after any in-session `gh` call that may write.
  A rerun reopens a completed run under the same id. Revalidation is a `304`,
  which GitHub does not charge against the rate limit, so the cost is small.

**Consequences:** every brokered read costs one extra local `gh` process (the
formatting run, about 50 ms) and a loopback round trip. It saves a GitHub
request whenever the cache is fresh. When the cache is stale, the request is
a free `304`. Error responses cost two requests. Endpoints with `{owner}`
placeholders, `--paginate` and porcelain commands are not brokered until
later phases. A write outside clud sessions is seen within one TTL (30-60 s).

## DD-151: merged gh reads keep exact object bytes and fall back rather than approximate

**Context:** phase 2 of #1743 answers comment and workflow-run-list reads by
merging a bounded upstream delta (`since=`, `created=>=`) into a stored
membership, and freezes job and check-run listings once they are finished.
A merged answer is only acceptable if it equals what the caller's own query
would return from GitHub. The design also asked for per-run ETag
revalidation of unfinished runs in a run list, and for `pr merge`/`pr
comment`/`run rerun` to invalidate only what they touch.

**Decision:**

- Members are stored as the exact JSON bytes GitHub sent (serde_json
  `RawValue`); the merge only reorders and cuts whole objects. A page is
  merged only if its parsed members re-render to the received bytes, so a
  new wrapper key, whitespace or an object without id and timestamps sends
  the collection to the phase-1 exact-URL path instead. So do caller
  queries a membership cannot reproduce (`page` > 1, `since`, `sort`, a
  run `status` filter, an unknown parameter).
- The run list refreshes unfinished runs by widening its own `created>=`
  bound to the oldest unfinished run, instead of one conditional request per
  run. One request covers the new runs and every live one, through the same
  list serializer whose bytes the merge reproduces; the single-run endpoint
  is a different representation. The window is capped at five pages, after
  which the list is fetched in full.
- The high-water mark is the newest timestamp seen in the membership, with a
  5 s overlap deduplicated by id; on an `updated_at` tie the later fetch
  wins, because reaction counts and run status change without moving it.
- Invalidation is tag-based (`gh_broker::scope`). A recognized write names
  the issue/PR, run, run list or check tags it can change, plus `other`,
  which every untagged read carries. An unrecognized write stays global and
  is the only thing besides a matching tag that thaws a frozen listing. A
  write that names a collection makes its next refresh a full fetch, since
  `since=` cannot see the deletion `pr comment --delete-last` makes.
- A check-run listing freezes only after it has been complete for 5
  minutes, because apps and later workflows can add check runs to a
  finished commit; a jobs listing freezes only once the run object itself
  reports `completed`.

**Consequences:** a merged read usually costs what the phase-1 read cost
(one request, or a free `304` when its bound and ETag repeat) and transfers
only changed objects. Its bounds are five pages for a delta and ten for a
full comment fetch. A page GitHub sends in another order than the merge
assumes makes the collection unmergeable rather than reordered. Deletions,
and changes that do not move `updated_at` (reaction counts, outdated review
comments), are seen at the 30-minute reconciliation;
reruns of finished runs started outside clud are seen in a run list only
then, and thaw a frozen jobs listing only after an in-session write names
the run. Collections over 10 pages or 8 MiB are not merged.

Superseded in part by DD-153: the delta query, the 30-minute reconciliation
and frozen listings are gone.

## DD-152: a running session's aliases are relinked by the installed clud, not self-delegated

**Context:** a session keeps the alias directory it launched with
(`~/.clud/state/rm-shim`), so after an upgrade its `gh`, `git` and `rm` keep
running the old binary until some later launch relinks the shared directory.
That left the #1743 read broker (2.8.24) out of every session launched
before it, which also lacks the `CLUD_GH_READ_BROKER` key the launch
exports. Two mechanisms could bring such a session's aliases up to date:
the alias could delegate to `$CLUD_EXE` when that binary is newer, or the
shared directory could be relinked from the new binary.

**Decision:**

- Relink, from the installed `clud`. `main` calls
  `shim_install::refresh_running_session_aliases` on every CLI start, before
  clap. A session's statusline (every 2 s in Claude Code), its session hooks
  and its `clud tool` calls all run the installed `clud` by absolute path, so
  the first of them after an upgrade relinks the directory. Self-delegation
  was rejected: an already-deployed binary cannot learn to delegate, so it
  would only help sessions launched after a second upgrade; it would let an
  environment variable pick the code behind the `rm` catastrophe floor; and
  it would add an exec to every shim call (Windows has no exec).
- The refresh acts only when the running `clud` is the session's own
  `CLUD_EXE`, the session's `CLUD_SHIM_ABI` equals the binary's `SHIM_ABI`,
  the session's alias dir is the shared one and exists, and no stale alias
  is as new as or newer (by mtime) than the running `clud`, checked again
  under the install lock. A dev build run by hand never takes the shared
  directory, an ABI change never makes this session's aliases fail open,
  and two installed versions never relink it back and forth.
- It reuses the launch installer's lock and rename-over replacement, so no
  alias is ever truncated in place or seen half-written, limited to hardlink
  and symlink: a failure (a Windows alias busy running) is retried on the
  next call cheaply instead of copying all of `clud` every 2 s.
- The daemon does not refresh. It restarts only under a launch, `clud gc`
  or a `clud daemon`/`clud ui` call, and a launch relinks anyway; the CLI
  start already covers every session.
- A `gh` alias in a session without `CLUD_GH_READ_BROKER` reads
  `git.gh_read_broker` from the settings (default on) instead of treating
  the missing key as off. An explicit `0` stays off.

**Consequences:** a running session picks up shim fixes within one
statusline tick of an upgrade, with no restart. Its env stays the one it
launched with, so only behavior keyed off settings or absent keys changes;
a change that needs a new session key still needs a new launch, and an ABI
bump still waits for one. The session's `clud-cmd-scan` hook alias in
`helper-bin` is not refreshed here; the next launch relinks it. Every
`clud` CLI start costs a few `stat` calls, and each `gh` call in a
pre-2.8.24 session takes the settings lock once.

## DD-153: merged gh reads revalidate every page instead of querying a delta

**Context:** phase 2 of #1743 (DD-151) refreshed merged collections with a
bounded delta (`since=` for comments, `created>=` for run lists), reconciled
in full every 30 minutes, and froze finished job and check-run listings until
an in-session write named them. So a deleted comment or run, a change that
does not move `updated_at` (a reaction count, a review comment going
outdated), a rerun of a finished run started outside clud, and a check run
added late to a finished commit were seen only at reconciliation or never.
Measured on 2026-10-02: an authorized `304` does not count against the rate
limit (15 conditional requests moved `X-RateLimit-Used` by the same
background drift as 15 calls to the free `rate_limit` endpoint), and every
endpoint involved returns a `304` to its own ETag.

**Decision:**

- A merged collection is stored as the upstream pages it last received, each
  with its ETag. Every refresh re-sends every page with `If-None-Match`. A
  `304` keeps the page; a `200` replaces it. GitHub's ETag covers the whole
  body, so this sees deletions, reactions, outdated review comments and
  reruns on the next refresh. Only a short page ends a collection: a new
  comment can open a page without changing the full page before it.
- When a pass replaced a page of a multi-page collection, every page before
  the last is re-checked with its new ETag. A deletion between two page
  requests shifts the later pages, and pages from both sides of it would
  lose an object. A re-check that is not a `304`, or a joined membership out
  of order, runs the pass once more; a second misfit answers that read
  from the exact URL and keeps the stored pages for the next refresh.
- The delta query is removed, not kept alongside. It cost the same charged
  request for a change and then a second charged `200` on the next refresh,
  because the moved bound made a new URL with no ETag; the page re-send
  costs a free `304` there. A count check (the issue's `comments`) was
  considered for multi-page collections and rejected: the issue object's
  ETag changes with every new comment, so the check would be a second
  charged request per change, and it still could not see a reaction on a
  later page.
- A run list keeps only its newest page, at the narrowest of 10, 30 and 100
  that covers the widest caller seen. A changed run list is re-sent whole,
  and 100 runs are about 1.2 MB on a busy repo.
- Job and check-run listings no longer freeze. Any check that could thaw
  them (the run object's `run_attempt` and `updated_at`, the commit's run
  list) costs the same one free `304` as revalidating the listing itself,
  and only the listing's own ETag also sees a check run another app adds to
  a finished commit.

**Consequences:** every change outside clud sessions to a merged collection
or listing is seen within one TTL, at no rate-limit cost while nothing
changed. A quiet multi-page collection costs one free request per page per
refresh instead of one, and a finished listing a free request per TTL
instead of none: wall time and local `gh` processes, not budget. A change
re-sends the whole page it is on, where the delta sent only the changed
objects. The ledger records `removed` (objects deleted upstream) beside
`changed`, and a merged `304` means every page was a `304`.

## DD-154: gh waiters block on broker subscriptions, and background refreshes yield below a reserve

**Context:** phase 3 of #1743. With the read broker, an in-session
`pr_merge_watch.py` still woke every 20 s, made a GraphQL call, re-read its
REST state (cheap through the broker, but not free) and asked `gh run view`
for every pending run's jobs (never brokered). Several watchers and agents
also share one 5,000/hour budget, and nothing kept a share of it for the
person at the prompt. The design asked for subscriptions ("waiters are woken
on change or terminal state") and a 10% floor below which background readers
wait for the reset while interactive ones go through. Gates must fail
closed.

**Decision:**

- `POST /gh/watch` blocks for up to 55 s on a set of at most 16 REST reads,
  re-reading them through the broker's ordinary read path once a second.
  The TTL is the refresh cadence, and single-flight makes every subscriber
  and every reader of a key share one upstream request. A change is a
  different body digest. A failed read is never a change, and it is retried
  after one TTL. "Terminal state" needs no special case: a merged PR or a
  finished check is a change, and the waiter's own poll decides what it
  means.
- The watcher keeps all of its judgment. It replaces only its steady-state
  sleep with a subscription wait (heartbeat: six intervals), so every exit
  code and verdict path is the polling code. Where a verdict is counted in
  polls or timed by a clock (no-checks grace, `mergeable=UNKNOWN`,
  CodeRabbit wait, `--max-queued`), it keeps the interval.
- Rate-limit windows are tracked per identity from every upstream response.
  Below the reserve, a non-interactive read is served the stored copy,
  marked stale on stderr and in the ledger (`deferred`), or, with nothing
  stored, goes to the real `gh`. "Interactive" is the shim's stdin being a
  terminal. Blocking a read until the reset (up to an hour) was rejected: it
  would hang every script and hook. Failing it was rejected too: it would
  turn a watcher's budget problem into an "unreachable" exit.
- The watcher never decides on a stale copy: a poll whose `gh` stderr
  carries the marker neither fails nor passes. So the floor can delay a
  verdict, but never fabricate or reverse one.
- The reserve is a daemon-side setting, `git.gh_read_broker_reserve_pct`
  (default 10, `CLUD_GH_BROKER_RESERVE_PCT` overrides it), because the
  daemon is the only place that sees every caller's spending.
- The watcher's REST reads are conditional in every mode: brokered in a
  session, with its own `If-None-Match` outside one. Its job progress comes
  from REST instead of `gh run view`. `ci/publish.py`'s release wait
  revalidates the run with its ETag under a 3-hour deadline. This also
  satisfies zackees/ci.yml's GHAPI-001 static rule, with same-line
  allowances only for bounded retries, once-per-head or on-exit reads, and
  GraphQL (which has no ETag).

**Consequences:** a quiet watch costs one free `304` per watched key per TTL,
no GraphQL and no job reads until something changes or the heartbeat fires.
A change wakes it within one TTL (30 s for runs, 60 s for the rest). A
change that lands between a poll and the following baseline, on a key the
poll read only through GraphQL, is seen at the heartbeat. Below the floor,
watchers stall until the reset instead of draining the budget. A person's
`gh api` still goes through, and nothing reports success on cached data.
The watcher's copy of `FORWARDED_ENV` is pinned by a test.

## DD-155: checkout claims live on daemon connections

**Context:** Two agent sessions can enter the same Git checkout and make
conflicting commits or branch changes. A lock file can outlive a killed
process and cannot distinguish independent worktrees of one repository.

**Decision:** The daemon records a canonical worktree and common Git directory
for each live foreground connection. It grants at most one mutation claim per
worktree and removes claims when their connection closes. Claiming clients keep
an intent marker in daemon state so they can restore their claim after daemon
restart; the daemon gives existing clients a short grace period before a new
claim can be granted. A confirmed release clears the live claim and its
marker. The PreToolUse hook queries the daemon only for selected mutating Git
verbs, and fails open with a warning when the daemon is unavailable. If claim
restoration loses a race after the grace period, the foreground client
interrupts its agent instead of continuing without a claim.

**Consequences:** A killed client releases its claim without stale lock
cleanup. Sibling worktrees remain independent. A claim requiring command
refuses to proceed while the daemon is down, while ordinary launches and
commands without a mutation claim continue.

## DD-156: `--unsafe` is an explicit session policy, separate from backend permissions

**Context:** clud already launches agents with the backend's permission bypass
by default, but its own command scanner, deletion rewrite, `rm` catastrophe
floor, shell guards, and generated instructions still constrain their actions.
`--safe` controls the backend permission prompts and cannot express an opt-out
of clud's safeguards. The safeguards are spread across launch settings, hooks,
and shims, so removing only one would leave an inconsistent session.

**Decision:** `--unsafe` disables clud's own agent safety policy for one launch
and its subagents. It is mutually exclusive with `--safe`; neither setting is
saved. `LaunchPlan` records the choice for settings and dry runs. The launching
process exports a session marker, and the shared child environment builder
passes it to helpers. A nested clud launch clears an inherited marker before
applying its own flag, and the daemon drops its inherited marker before merging
a new client's environment. The command scanner skips clud's command rules in
unsafe mode but still dispatches independently declared hooks and registers
git path captures with GC. The `rm` alias uses its ordinary real-binary
passthrough, and an explicit `safe-rm` keeps its normal behavior.

**Consequences:** callers can deliberately run real deletion commands and
other commands clud normally refuses. A later launch returns to the default
policy without changing settings or reinstalling hooks. The backend's own
permission mode and the user's project hooks remain independent. The full
scope and verification contract live in
[unsafe-mode.md](architecture/unsafe-mode.md).

## DD-157: sibling checkout cleanup uses an explicit session grant

**Context:** #1784: an authorized migration may edit a sister checkout but
`safe-rm` still refuses to trash obsolete tracked files there. The user-level
`safe_rm.extra_roots` setting from DD-137 is deliberately unavailable to an
agent, and Codex lacks Claude's session ID for the creation ledger.

**Decision:** `safe-rm --grant-root <checkout> --reason <reason>` records an
explicit session-scoped grant only for an existing sibling Git checkout. It
stores the canonical path, session ID, timestamp, and reason under
`~/.clud/state/rm-grants/`. On Unix it also stores the checkout's device and
inode. Every deletion reloads the record and checks that the checkout still
exists beside the launch checkout; Unix additionally rejects a replaced
checkout. The checkout root itself remains protected; child paths get the
existing ownership, symlink and trash checks. Codex children receive a unique
`CLUD_SESSION_ID`; Claude's own session ID is preserved. This narrow grant
does not change `safe_rm.extra_roots` or permit arbitrary directories.

**Consequence:** an agent can carry out an explicitly authorized sister-repo
cleanup with the recoverable trash command. The grant and each deletion carry
the reason in an audit record. Policy and syntax:
[rm-tools.md](architecture/rm-tools.md#authorized-sibling-checkouts-1784).

## DD-158: shared Cargo targets are opt-in for serialized worktree builds

**Context:** #1685: each Rust worktree's private `target/` duplicates
dependency artifacts. A sequential Linux measurement with `soldr cargo check
-p clud --lib` found a 45.7 s check and 889 MB target for a fresh worktree
with a warm compiler cache, versus 2.25 s using an already populated shared
target on identical source. Changing a workspace source comment made the shared
check take 16.8 s.

**Decision:** `/clud-git` documents `CARGO_TARGET_DIR=<main-checkout>/target`
as an explicit option for sequential Rust work. `/grind` keeps private targets
when branches may build or test concurrently. Clud does not set
`CARGO_TARGET_DIR` automatically.

**Consequences:** dependency artifacts and disk space can be reused when the
operator serializes builds. Cargo's target lock also serializes competing
writers; workspace outputs and binaries can be replaced by another branch's
build, so concurrent branch tests must retain private targets. Measurement
details and limits are in [skill-system.md](architecture/skill-system.md#worktree-cargo-targets-1685).

## DD-159: warn once per settings file for project-syncing hook commands

**Context:** #1739: several native PreToolUse hooks can fail together when a
working-tree dependency pin is unavailable. Claude Code renders a nonblocking
hook failure once per invocation, with only the first stderr line visible to
the user and no agent context. Clud does not own native hook execution.

**Decision:** Hook health counts active PreToolUse commands that invoke
`uv run` without `--no-sync` or `--no-project`, and prints one
launch warning per settings file for both Claude and Codex launches. It
recommends the flags that avoid a working-tree dependency sync; `--frozen`
alone still syncs. Clud does not
rewrite project-owned hook commands or claim to alter Claude's renderer.

**Consequence:** users see the fragile hook configuration before the first
tool call, with a count instead of one warning per hook. Native runtime
deduplication and delivery of failures to the agent remain upstream work.

## DD-160: DeepSeek Harness is a clud-managed npm prefix driven by a launch overlay

**Context.** #942 left `dsh` PATH-only: upstream ships it only as an npm
developer preview (`npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web`), and clud did not want to
change global npm state. #1829 needs `clud --harness dsh` and
`clud --openrouter --harness dsh` to work on a clean machine with keys clud
already holds.

**Decision.** Install a pinned `@deepseek-ai/dsh` plus a pinned private
`node` package into a versioned prefix under `~/.clud/harnesses/dsh/`.
Pass provider keys only through the child environment. Select OpenRouter with
a clud-owned overlay passed through dsh's own `--patch` flag.

**Why not the alternatives.**
- *`npx` on every launch* resolves a moving tag and re-downloads on a cold
  cache. *Global npm* changes state the user owns. A versioned private prefix
  can be pinned, verified, rolled back, and left alone when the user has their
  own `dsh`.
- *The system Node* is unreliable: dsh 0.2.0-rc.2 requires
  `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`, and under Node 26 its native addon fails at boot even
  though `engines` admits it. The private Node 24 removes both failure modes
  and needs only npm from the host.
- *Writing `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml` or the user's profile* would create a
  second copy of a secret clud cannot rotate, and would edit files the user
  owns. dsh documents env precedence per run and `--patch` overlays applied
  after every profile layer, so neither write is needed.
- *A fork* was the fallback if upstream could not be pointed at OpenRouter
  without UI interaction. It was not needed: the overlay alone selects dsh's
  built-in `openrouter` route, verified end to end against a mock of the
  Anthropic Messages endpoint.

## DD-161: the user's home directory has exactly one resolver

**Context.** #1829 shipped a Windows-only bug: the managed DeepSeek Harness
installed under `dirs::home_dir()` (the Windows Known Folder profile) while
backend discovery searched `USERPROFILE`, so with an isolated home the launch
fell back to a bare `dsh`. Only native CI caught it. An audit (#1836) found 26
library `home_dir` calls and about 20 private helpers re-implementing "where is
home", with small differences: empty values honored or not, `USERPROFILE`
checked first even on Unix, an OS fallback or none.

**Decision.** `crates/clud-bin/src/home.rs::user_home` is the only resolver:
on Windows `USERPROFILE`, then `HOME`, then the OS profile folder; elsewhere
`HOME`, then the OS lookup; empty values are ignored. That is the precedence
`clud_settings` already used, so `~/.clud` does not move for anyone. Two
guards hold the line: `ci/banned_home_dir.py` in `bash lint` bans
`dirs::home_dir`-style calls and raw `USERPROFILE` reads (every Windows-correct
copy of the rule must read it), and the `ban_dirs_home_dir` Dylint lint bans
the calls by resolved path, which also catches renamed imports.

**Why both guards.** Dylint runs off the PR path (`_dylint.yml`, `ci-full`),
which is how #1829's bug reached native CI. The text guard runs locally and on
every PR; Dylint covers what text cannot see.

**Exceptions.** `InstallPathEnv` snapshots the raw variables so bootstrap
tests can inject them, and its consumers resolve through `home::resolve`.
`crates/tap` is a one-dependency binary that cannot link clud. A helper with a
distinct meaning, such as `hook_home_dir`'s `CLUD_HOOK_HOME` override, may
wrap the resolver but never re-derive it.

## DD-162: Codex launches default to auto review for approvals

**Context.** Codex can send approval requests (sandbox escapes, blocked
network, MCP prompts) to an auto-review subagent instead of the user. The
config key is `approvals_reviewer = "auto_review"` (default `"user"`). The
`--approve-for-me` flag also sets `approval_policy="on-request"` and
`sandbox_mode="workspace-write"` (#1847).

**Decision.** Every Codex-harness launch emits
`-c approvals_reviewer="auto_review"` after the configured `config_overrides`
and before the subcommand, so the interactive TUI, `exec` and `resume` all get
it. clud sets only the reviewer, never `--approve-for-me`: the approval policy
and sandbox stay with YOLO (DD-002) or `--safe`.

**Why it is harmless under YOLO.** `--dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox`
raises no approval requests, so the reviewer is idle. It takes effect on
`--safe` launches, which otherwise stop and wait for the user.

**Opt-out.** A reviewer the user already chose wins: an `approvals_reviewer=`
entry in the clud settings `codex.config_overrides`, or passthrough
`-c`/`--config approvals_reviewer=…`, `--approve-for-me` or `--not-so-yolo`.
Like other clud `-c` overrides, the injected value takes precedence over
`~/.codex/config.toml`.


## DD-163: video-use is a session-scoped plugin pinned to a reviewed SHA

**Context.** browser-use/video-use is a Claude Code skill whose documented
install symlinks it into `~/.claude/skills/`. A skill there, or a bundled clud
skill, is eligible to trigger in every session. The user asked for video-use
only under a dedicated subcommand (#1851). It is also a fast-moving
third-party repo that tells the agent to run shell commands and spends paid
ElevenLabs credits.

**Decision.** `clud video` keeps a checkout pinned to one reviewed commit
under `~/.clud/extern/video-use/<sha>/`, wraps it in a clud-owned plugin
directory, and passes that wrapper to the Claude harness with the
session-only `--plugin-dir`. No `BUNDLED_SKILLS` row, no write to
`~/.claude/skills` or `~/.codex/skills`, so DD-039's single installer is
untouched. Bumping the pin is a reviewed change. The command is Claude-only,
because `--plugin-dir` is a Claude Code feature. The ElevenLabs key is a
plain vault secret (`clud.elevenlabs/api-key-v1`), not a `clud auth`
provider, because it routes no model traffic.

**Rejected.** A bundled skill (auto-triggers everywhere); tracking upstream
`main` (unreviewed shell instructions on every launch); a `clud auth`
provider row for ElevenLabs (that registry describes model routes).
