# GC & Registry

`clud` maintains two separate `redb` databases for two separate concerns: a per-launch
**session cap** that bounds how many sibling `clud` processes may run concurrently, and a
**tracked-entry GC** that owns the lifecycle of `.claude/worktrees/agent-*`, `.extern-repos/*`,
and known sibling temp-clone directories across repos and across invocations. The two stores live
in different files, on different code paths,
with different ownership models — they have nothing to do with each other besides both being
`redb`-backed, and confusing them is the single fastest way to wedge the system. This doc covers
both, plus the worktree scanner that feeds the GC store and the unrelated `--clean-worktrees`
subcommand.


## Where extern checkouts live

Since #986 a repo's foreign checkouts live **beside** it — `~/dev/myrepo` keeps
them in `~/dev/myrepo-extern/` — rather than in an in-tree `.extern-repos/`.
The GC watches both: a fourth `EXTERN_REPO_KIND` watch root points at the
sibling, alongside the legacy in-tree one, so checkouts users already have keep
being tracked while they move.

The sibling needed its own watch root rather than a widening of the
sibling-clone one, because that scanner inserts immediate children of the
repo's *parent* directory, and a checkout at `<repo>-extern/dep` is a
grandchild of it. Registry rows were already keyed on absolute paths, so
nothing about tracking, sweeping, or reclaiming changed.

`extern_root.rs` owns the location; see DD-053 for why it moved.

## Two redb databases

| File | Concern | Ownership | Lifetime |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sessions.redb` (POSIX: `$XDG_STATE_HOME/clud/`; Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\clud\`) | Per-launch session cap | File-lock serialized via `sessions.lock` | Opened for ms at startup and again at shutdown; never across the session |
| `~/.clud/data.redb` | Tracked-entry GC (`agent-*` worktrees, extern repos, sibling temp clones) | Single-owner: the `clud __daemon` process owns it via the in-process `daemon/gc_service.rs` registry-worker thread; everyone else uses JSON-over-TCP | Opened once per daemon lifetime; released after safe idle shutdown (900 seconds by default) |

Why two files? The session cap is a *guardrail* — it needs the simplest possible "open, decide,
close" semantics so a crashed `clud` can never deadlock the next one. The tracked-entry GC is a
*long-running registry* with reconcile/list/purge operations, concurrent insert traffic from the
scanner thread, and a CLI surface that benefits from being able to ask "what's tracked?" without
re-walking every repo.

Splitting them lets each pick the right concurrency model. Mixing them would force the daemon to
also be in the startup-cap critical path, which is a recipe for fork-bomb-with-a-twist when the
daemon hangs.

Both files use the redb invariant **one writer per process** (`flock` on POSIX, `LockFileEx` on
Windows). The two architectures below are different solutions to that one constraint.

## Session cap registry

Background: issue #73 — a buggy test spawned 100+ console windows from a single terminal. The cap
is a hard guardrail against that class of mistake.

The schema is a single `redb` table `sessions` keyed by `pid: u32` → JSON-serialized `SessionRow`
(`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:94`, `crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:103`). A
sibling `meta` table records `schema_version` (`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:97`).

Lifecycle on each `clud` launch:

1. **Acquire** the cross-process advisory lock at `sessions.lock` next to `sessions.redb`
   (`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:613`). Blocks until exclusive.
2. **Open** the redb file (`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:402`).
3. **GC** dead rows whose PID no longer names a live process, using `OsLivenessProbe`
   (`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:471`). On Windows the probe is
   `OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION) + GetExitCodeProcess`; on POSIX it is
   `kill(pid, 0)`.
4. **Check** the cap (`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:512`). Three outcomes: `Allow`,
   `Warn(n)` (at or above `cap/2`), or `Refuse(n)` (at or above cap).
5. **Register** this PID via `register_self` if not refused
   (`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:520`). On `Refuse`, the row is **not** inserted —
   the caller exits, and inserting would inflate the count for the next sibling.
6. **Drop** the redb handle, then **release** the lock. The lock is held for a few ms — not for
   the lifetime of the session.

Shutdown re-acquires the lock briefly and removes the row via `unregister`
(`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:546`). A crashed `clud` leaves a stale row that the
next startup's GC pass cleans up.

The whole startup sequence is wrapped by `run_startup_under_lock`
(`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:677`) and the shutdown counterpart by
`run_shutdown_under_lock` (`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:713`). The lock-then-redb
ordering is important: redb's file lock is released when its `Drop` runs, and we want that to
happen *before* the `sessions.lock` releases so the next sibling can open redb the instant it
acquires the advisory lock.

**Env overrides:**

- `CLUD_MAX_INSTANCES` (default 64; `0` disables the cap entirely;
  `crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:70`).
- `CLUD_WARN_INSTANCES` (default `cap/2`).
- `CLUD_SESSION_DB`, `CLUD_SESSION_LOCK` — test overrides for the file paths.

## Clud daemon (single-owner data.redb)

`~/.clud/data.redb` is held by **exactly one process at a time**: the lazily spawned
`clud __daemon` subprocess. It is not permanently resident: after 900 seconds without
owned work it exits and releases the database; the next ordinary daemon-using invocation
brings it back through `ensure_daemon`.
Issue #135 Phase 1 originally introduced this as a separate `gc_daemon`; [DD-012] folded it
into the existing session daemon so there's one daemon per user that hosts both `--detach` /
`attach` / `list` / etc. and the GC registry. The single-owner-of-redb invariant is unchanged —
only the owning process identity moved.

The merged daemon's GC half:

1. Binds a loopback TCP port on `127.0.0.1:0` (kernel-assigned, shared with session-management
   IPC).
2. Spawns one **registry worker thread** that owns the `Registry` handle and is the sole
   reader/writer of the redb file (`crates/clud-bin/src/daemon/gc_service.rs:spawn_registry_worker`).
   The session-management half of the daemon runs in the same process but on different threads;
   nothing else touches the redb handle.
3. Atomically writes `(pid, port)` JSON to `~/.clud/state/daemon.json`
   (`crates/clud-bin/src/daemon/server.rs`).
4. Serves connections forever: accept thread → per-connection thread →
   `mpsc::Sender<GcRequestMsg>` → worker thread → reply on a per-request `mpsc::sync_channel(1)`
   (`crates/clud-bin/src/daemon/server.rs::dispatch_gc_op`).

Wire protocol is JSON-over-loopback-TCP, one request per connection. The session daemon's
existing `DaemonRequest`/`DaemonResponse` enum gained two variants:
`DaemonRequest::Gc { payload: GcOp }` and `DaemonResponse::Gc { reply: GcReply }`. Inside,
`GcOp` carries `list` / `purge` / `reconcile` / `insert` (`crates/clud-bin/src/daemon/types.rs`);
`GcReply` carries `list_ok` / `purge_ok` / `reconcile_ok` / `insert_ok` / `error`.

**Creation-ledger rows (#1666).** `data.redb` also holds the `created` row
kind in its own `created_entries` table, keyed by `(session id, canonical
path)` (`gc::CreatedEntry`: kind `dir`/`file`, role, time, Unix dev/ino/uid).
`GcOp::insert_created` / `query_created` reach it through the same worker
(replies `created_insert_ok` / `created_rows_ok`); the periodic tick expires
rows older than 72h (`Registry::expire_created`). Their only reader is
`safe-rm`; see [rm-tools.md](rm-tools.md#creation-ledger).

`ensure_daemon(state_dir)` (`crates/clud-bin/src/daemon/client.rs`) is the idempotent bringup
entry point, called from `main.rs` on every clud invocation. It reads `daemon.json`, probes the
PID, and if alive + accepting TCP, returns. Otherwise it acquires `<state_dir>/daemon.lock`
(issue #138 — serializes concurrent bringup so two `clud` startups don't both spawn a daemon and
race on the TCP bind), **re-probes** under the lock, and only spawns if still absent.

Spawn is `clud __daemon --state-dir <state_dir>` detached via `daemon::client::spawn_detached_daemon` (running-process's daemon spawn, #1186)
with `invisible_helper_creationflags()` on Windows. Caller polls up to 5 seconds for the info
file plus a successful TCP connect.

### Idle lifetime policy

`~/.clud/settings.json` seeds `daemon.idle_timeout_secs` to `900`. Set a positive value to
choose a different timeout; set `0` to disable automatic retirement. The value is read at daemon
startup, not repeatedly on the listener path. Expiry is safe only when all of these are zero:
daemon workers, foreground-client leases, active TCP/HTTP/broker connections, and background
maintenance jobs. Each shutdown appends `daemon_idle_shutdown` with the timeout, elapsed idle
time, and every counter so an unexpected exit can be diagnosed from the event log.

## GC subcommands

The tracked-entry subcommands are thin IPC clients against the daemon. `--no-daemon`
is **an error**, not a fallback — there is no read-only path in v1
(`crates/clud-bin/src/gc/cli.rs`).

- **`clud gc list [--json]`** — `cmd_list` (`crates/clud-bin/src/gc/cli.rs`) calls
  `daemon::gc_client_list`, prints a table (or JSON). Each row reports
  `kind / age / agent_id / branch / state / path` plus a `live_locked` flag computed by the
  daemon by parsing `git worktree list --porcelain` and extracting `(pid <N>)` from any
  `locked <reason>` line.

  **Row state and reason (issue #896).** Once the extern-repo guard began refusing to
  reclaim checkouts holding local work, a pinned row became indistinguishable from garbage
  GC keeps failing to collect. Every row therefore carries a `state` —
  `reclaimable | pinned | dangling` — plus a short `reason` for the non-default states. The
  human table paints `pinned` yellow and `dangling` red; `--json` carries `state`, `reason`,
  `reclaimable` and `evaluated_unix` so tooling never parses ANSI.

  The load-bearing constraint is that **nothing on the registry worker thread runs the
  extern-repo git probe** — not `gc list`, not `gc purge`, not the periodic tick. That probe
  costs up to three subprocesses per checkout, and the worker is the single thread that owns
  redb, so every client op (including launch-path `record_repo_visit`) queues behind whatever
  it does.

  How verdicts are produced (issue #946):

  1. The periodic tick does the one thing only the worker can — `registry.list(extern-repo)` —
     and hands the rows to `spawn_extern_probe` (`gc_service.rs`).
  2. A `clud-gc-extern-probe` thread computes `extern_repo_purge_verdict` for each row and
     sends the **complete snapshot** back as `RegistryMsg::ExternVerdicts`, reusing the same
     background-thread → worker channel that `RegistryMsg::PurgeCompletion` already uses for
     the purge pool.
  3. The worker installs it with `SpareReasons::replace_extern` — wholesale replacement, so a
     row absent from the snapshot loses its verdict and the cache can never exceed the row
     count. Only one probe runs at a time (`begin_probe`/`probe_finished`, owned by the loop
     rather than a `static`, so a test binary's many workers do not share it).
  4. `partition_purgeable` and `GcOp::List` then *look up* verdicts instead of computing them.

  **A row with no verdict yet is spared, never purged.** A fresh daemon, or a checkout added
  since the last probe, has nothing cached; falling back to the mtime gate would delete a
  checkout no probe has ever inspected, which is the data loss the extern-repo guard exists
  to prevent. The visible consequence is that a checkout becomes reclaimable on the tick
  *after* it is first seen clean.

  `gc list` additionally does a `try_exists()` stat per row for the `dangling` state, and a
  verdict can be up to one tick stale (1 h by default — hence `evaluated_unix`).

  **The verdict is re-checked at delete time.** Decoupling put up to a tick between "this is
  clean and pushed" and `remove_dir_all`, and a developer can invalidate it in that window
  just by editing. So `reverify_before_delete` re-runs the verdict on the **purge-pool
  thread** — still off the worker, and immediately before the destructive call. A veto keeps
  the row and logs `spared … at delete time`. Before #946 this was implicit, because the
  verdict was computed inline microseconds earlier.

  Still *not* subprocess-free, and the doc should not pretend otherwise. Four worker-side
  paths still shell out through the deliberately-unbounded `worktrees::run_git`:
  `collect_live_lock_paths()` from `GcOp::List`, from `GcOp::DeleteById`, and from
  `partition_purgeable` (so twice per tick); plus `best_effort_branch` on the
  `GcOp::Reconcile` / `RegistryMsg::WatchRescan` paths. These are pre-existing and separate
  from the extern-repo probe that #946 moved.
- **`clud gc prune <kind> [--dry-run]`** and
  **`clud gc all [--dry-run]`** call `daemon::gc_client_purge` with the kind-specific safe
  prune policy. Worktree-like rows use the built-in stale duration, extern-repo rows rely on
  the cached probe verdict (recomputed at delete time), trash rows are reaped, and `uv-cache` uses its
  filesystem-only stale-env sweep.
- **`clud gc purge <kind> --yes [--dry-run]`** and
  **`clud gc all --purge --yes [--dry-run]`** are the destructive forms. The CLI requires
  a kind for single-kind purge and `--yes` for any destructive purge before contacting
  the daemon. Since #506 the kind is a positional argument (`--kind <name>` survives as a
  compatibility alias), and the pseudo-kind `all` routes prune/purge to the same
  every-managed-kind sweep as `clud gc all`: `clud gc purge all --yes` ≡
  `clud gc all --purge --yes`. The daemon selects candidates, partitions out live-locked worktrees or live
  session CWD ancestors, and:
  - `--dry-run` reports `removed` (the number that *would* be deleted) plus `skipped`. Replies
    `GcReply::PurgeOk { removed, skipped }` synchronously.
  - Non-dry-run **bulk** purge fans every purgeable entry out to the daemon's parallel purge pool
    (capped by `CLUD_GC_PURGE_CONCURRENCY`, default `min(num_cpus, 8)`) and returns
    immediately with `GcReply::PurgeStarted { dispatched, skipped }`. Each pool thread runs
    `remove_dir_all` / `git worktree remove --force` independently; on completion it sends a
    `RegistryMsg::PurgeCompletion(..)` back to the registry worker, which drops the matching
    redb row asynchronously. The redb writer never blocks on filesystem work — see #268.
  - Per-row delete (`GcOp::DeleteById`, dashboard "delete" button) stays on the synchronous path
    and replies `GcReply::PurgeOk { removed, skipped }` — exactly one entry, fast.
  Worktree rows use `git worktree remove --force`; if git fails or reports success while the
  directory survives, clud falls back to direct removal plus `git worktree prune`. Stale rows
  during/after a partial purge are tolerated — eventual consistency, not transactional; the
  next purge or list reconciles.
- **`clud gc reconcile`** — `cmd_reconcile` calls `daemon::gc_client_reconcile` with the
  current repo root. The daemon walks `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/`, `<repo>/.extern-repos/`, and
  conservative sibling temp-clone names next to the repo. Returns the count of new rows.

Bare `clud gc` (no subcommand) prints help and exits 0 without contacting the daemon
(`crates/clud-bin/src/gc/cli.rs`).

## Repo worktrees: squash-aware verdict (#1591) and reclaim (#1603)

Sibling worktrees such as `~/dev/clud2-wt-<issue>` match none of the tracked
kinds, and in a squash-merging repo their branch tips are never ancestors of
the default branch, so ancestry-based checks call them live work forever
([DD-122](../DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#dd-122-worktree-landed-verdicts-need-pr-or-patch-evidence-not-ancestry)).

- **Discovery.** Worktrees of repos already in the registry's repo-visit
  table (`record_repo_visit`), via `git worktree list --porcelain`; no
  filesystem crawl. Repos sharing a git common dir are probed once.
- **Where it runs.** The worker reads the visit list and hands it to a
  `clud-gc-repo-worktree-probe` thread (`spawn_repo_worktree_probe`), which
  sends a complete snapshot back as `RegistryMsg::RepoWorktreeVerdicts`, the
  same off-worker pattern as the extern-repo probe (#946). One probe at a
  time; primed at startup, refreshed each tick. All git/`gh` calls are
  bounded `running-process` spawns. The probe thread also takes one
  process-table snapshot (`collect_process_cwds`, below).
- **Verdict.** `repo_worktree_verdict` (`daemon/gc_service/repo_worktree.rs`)
  is a pure function over `RepoWorktreeFacts`; its doc table is the
  precedence. Reclaimable only on positive evidence: a merged PR (one
  `gh pr list --state all` per repo per tick) whose `headRefOid` is the local
  tip or has it as an ancestor, or, with no PR or no `gh`, the branch's
  cumulative `-U0` diff appearing verbatim as one default-branch commit.
  Spared, with a reason: `no verdict yet`, `main checkout`,
  `locked by live pid` (a lock with no parseable pid counts as live),
  `process inside` (a live session cwd or any process cwd),
  `process table unavailable`, `detached`, `dirty`, `untracked`,
  `open PR #N`, `commits after merge`, `no PR`, `unverifiable`, and under
  `~/.clud/tmp-wt` only, `grace` (see the #1485 subsection below).
- **Surfacing.** `clud gc list [--json]` appends `kind: repo-worktree` rows
  (`id: 0`, since no redb row backs them) with `state`, `reason`,
  `reclaimable` and `evaluated_unix`. A path the registry already tracks keeps
  its own row. A live session cwd inside pins the row at list time even if
  the snapshot is older.
- **Process table (#1603).** `collect_process_cwds` reads every visible
  process's cwd once (sysinfo) into a `ProcessCwdSnapshot`, and the pure
  `process_inside` decides against it, the `ProcessFacts` pattern from
  [process-reaping.md](process-reaping.md#daemon-sparing-os-signals-first-marker-second-whitelist-last).
  If the daemon cannot read its own cwd the snapshot is unavailable and every
  row spares as `process table unavailable`. The daemon's own `git` helpers
  (`own_git_helpers`) are ignored so a probe's `git status` does not pin the
  worktree it inspects.
- **Reclaim (#1603).** On each tick `run_repo_worktree_phase` walks the
  cached snapshot (taken by the *previous* probe) and, per the pure
  `reclaim_selection`, dispatches each `reclaimable` row with no live session
  cwd and no reclaim in flight to the purge pool as `PurgeWork::RepoWorktree`.
  The pool thread (`repo_worktree_reclaim_exec::run_reclaim`) re-probes that
  one worktree from scratch (fresh git, fresh `gh`, fresh process table) and
  `reverify_reclaim` vetoes on any change: verdict no longer reclaimable,
  branch changed, tip moved or unknown, worktree gone. Then, all through
  `running-process`: make read-only directories writable, `git worktree
  remove <path>` (**never** `--force`, so git itself refuses a tree that got
  dirty in the last instant), `git branch -D` only if the branch still points
  at the verified tip, optionally the remote branch (below), then `git
  worktree prune`. The outcome returns as `RegistryMsg::RepoWorktreeReclaimed`
  and is logged (`removed`, `spared at delete time: <reason>`, or `failed`);
  a removed row leaves the `gc list` snapshot. A failure is never retried
  with force: a locked worktree, or one with submodules, just stays.
  Rationale: [DD-123](../DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#dd-123-repo-worktree-reclaim-re-verifies-from-scratch-and-never-forces).
- **One reclaim per repo at a time (#1632).** The pool runs reclaims in
  parallel, but `run_reclaim_serialized` holds a per-repo mutex (keyed by the
  canonical repo root, `RepoLocks`) for the whole sequence above, so two
  worktrees of one repo are removed one after the other; different repos stay
  parallel. Concurrent git on one git dir failed with exit 255 on Windows.
  Reservation rows run no git and take no lock. Rationale:
  [DD-125](../DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#dd-125-repo-worktree-reclaims-are-serialized-per-repository-by-a-lock-on-the-pool-thread).
- **Remote branches.** Off by default. `gc.delete_remote_branches: true` in
  `~/.clud/settings.json` (seeded `false`), or
  `CLUD_GC_DELETE_REMOTE_BRANCHES=1`, also deletes `origin/<branch>`, only
  when the remote-tracking ref equals the verified tip, and the push carries
  `--force-with-lease=refs/heads/<branch>:<tip>`. `clud settings` exposes the
  setting as a toggle and notes when the env var overrides it (#1608).
- **Modes.** `CLUD_GC_REPO_WORKTREES`: unset or `1` deletes; `observe` (or
  any unrecognized value) probes and logs `would remove` without deleting;
  `0` turns the probe and the reclaim off.

### The worktree root `~/.clud/tmp-wt` (#1485)

- **Location.** `gc::worktree_root::worktree_root()` is `~/.clud/tmp-wt`, a
  *sibling* of the `session_tmp` root `~/.clud/tmp`, never inside it, so the
  72 h mtime sweep cannot see a worktree by construction
  ([DD-124](../DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#dd-124-agent-worktrees-live-in-a-sibling-of-the-session-temp-root-and-are-never-on-its-timer)).
  It is created idempotently at session launch (`runner.rs`) and at
  GC-worker start, and is never a removal target: `git worktree remove` only
  removes the child it is given.
- **Allocation.** The bundled `grind-plan` and `clud-git` skills allocate new
  agent worktrees as `~/.clud/tmp-wt/<repo>-wt-<suffix>`, keeping the
  `<repo>-wt-` shape reconcile's name matching expects. Existing sibling
  worktrees are not moved; the discovery above still covers them.
- **Discovery.** Each direct child of the root seeds the probe as a repo
  root (`worktree_root_children`), so a tmp-wt worktree is judged even if
  clud never recorded a visit to its repo. Same verdict, same reclaim path.
- **Abandoned-empty.** Only under the root: a clean, idle worktree whose
  branch has zero commits past its merge-base with the default branch, and no
  open or merged PR, is `reclaimable` / `abandoned-empty` once its directory
  mtime is 24 h old, and `pinned` / `grace` before that (or when the age is
  unknown). Nothing else in the verdict consults age.
- **Ordinal allocator (#1486).** `gc::worktree_root::alloc_wt_path(slug,
  suffix)` reserves `<root>/<slug>-wt-<suffix>` with one atomic `create_dir`
  and, on a collision, takes `-2`, `-3`, ... in order, so the path it returns
  already exists and two callers never share one. `slug` and `suffix` must
  each be one plain path component (`InvalidInput` otherwise, and nothing is
  reserved).
- **Reserved-unused (#1486).** A direct child of the root that no `git
  worktree list` claimed is judged by `repo_worktree::reserved_dir_verdict`
  (pure, decision-table tested) instead: an **empty**, idle directory with no
  `.git` entry is `reclaimable` / `reserved-unused` after the same 24 h grace
  and `pinned` / `grace` before it. A non-empty one is `pinned` / `not empty`,
  one holding a `.git` entry is `pinned` / `unlisted checkout`, and neither is
  ever deleted by this rule. The purge pool re-probes it from scratch
  (`reverify_reservation`) and then calls a plain `remove_dir`, which the OS
  refuses for a directory that gained an entry in the meantime; no git and no
  recursive delete is involved.
- **Size backstop.** `worktrees.warn_bytes` in `~/.clud/settings.json`
  (seeded 50 GiB, `0` disables): `clud gc list` prints a stderr warning when
  the root exceeds it (a bounded, early-exit walk). Warn-only: nothing is
  deleted for size. The launch banner warns too (#1610) without walking:
  the daemon's repo-worktree probe thread runs the same bounded walk after
  each probe and writes `~/.clud/tmp-wt-size.json` (timestamp, limit,
  over/under/unknown + bytes; atomic temp-file rename). At launch
  `gc::worktree_size_cache::launch_warning` reads only that file and a
  lock-free settings peek, and prints one line naming the size, threshold,
  path and setting. It shows nothing when `warn_bytes` is `0`, the cache is
  missing, corrupt, older than 6 h or future-dated, or the walk ran out of
  entry budget (`clud gc list` still reports that case). The decision is the
  pure `banner_decision` table. If the probe never runs (reclaim mode `off`)
  the cache is never written and the banner stays silent.
- **Tests.** Unit tests never read the real root: `production_worktree_root()`
  and `ensure_worktree_root()` return `None` under `cfg(test)`, and tests
  inject a tempdir root.

## Filesystem sweeps (non-registry)

Alongside the redb-tracked kinds, the daemon's periodic tick
(`run_periodic_purge_tick` in `crates/clud-bin/src/daemon/gc_service.rs`) runs four
**filesystem-only** sweeps that have no registry row — they operate directly on directories
under `~/.clud` (and, opt-in, on external dev roots). Each self-throttles via a sentinel
timestamp under `~/.clud/state/` so the per-tick cost is one stat + age compare.

| Sweep | Target | Age gate | Cadence sentinel | Enabled |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| uv-cache (#423) | `~/.clud/cache/uv/environments-v2/` | 72h | `uv-cache-sweep.last` (24h) | always |
| session-temp (#509) | `~/.clud/tmp/` | 72h | `session-tmp-sweep.last` (6h) | default on |
| session-state (#1014) | `~/.clud/state/sessions/` | 48h ambient / 30d notable | `session-state-sweep.last` (6h) | always |
| target (#510) | `target/` dirs under `CLUD_GC_TARGET_ROOTS` | 3d | `target-sweep.last` (24h) | opt-in |

**Session temp (#509).** At session launch the backend agent's temp env (`TMPDIR` on Unix,
`TMP`+`TEMP` on Windows) is pointed at `~/.clud/tmp` by both env builders
(`runner.rs::child_env` and `daemon/io_helpers.rs::child_env`) via
`crate::gc::session_tmp::env_overrides`, so the agent's temp scatter lands somewhere the daemon
can reclaim. Set `CLUD_SESSION_TMP=0` to keep the OS temp dir. If the dir can't be created the
override is silently skipped (the child keeps the OS temp dir) — launch never fails on this.

The session-temp sweep (#1260) starts on the six-hour cadence, but stores a work queue at
`~/.clud/state/session-tmp-sweep.work.json`. Its background worker continues and checkpoints
while work advances; it does not wait for another hourly GC tick or impose a deadline on a large
candidate. Deferred failures resume on a later tick. Candidate freshness scanning must finish before deletion, and a resumable
recheck precedes each destructive batch. Recent activity stops removal of the remaining tree.
File, directory, metadata-probe, scan, and exploration failures stay queued with backoff while
other candidates advance. A 72-hour
period of repeated failure without progress emits a nonfatal persistent-failure signal. An item
that fails `MAX_ITEM_RETRIES` (8, about 36 minutes of backoff) times in a row is dropped from
the queue and so spared; the next pass re-derives it from disk. A candidate that no longer exists
completes instead of failing. Owner-writable read-only directories inside an idle candidate are
made writable (`chmod u+wx`) and the unlink retried once; foreign-owned files still fail and are
abandoned. Without the bound, one root-owned file kept the queue non-empty, a new pass never
started, and nothing that went stale later was ever looked at (#1672,
[DD-142](../DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#dd-142-a-session-tmp-sweep-pass-always-retires)). `daemon-events.jsonl` records per-tick examined entries, files and
directories removed, reclaimed apparent bytes, pending phases, retry count, work age, and the
last error path/class, current phase/path, and cursor position. An exclusive lock prevents
concurrent daemons from overwriting the continuation queue.

**Session temp size warning (#1327).** `tmp.warn_bytes` in `~/.clud/settings.json` (seeded
20 GiB, `0` disables) is the `~/.clud/tmp` twin of `worktrees.warn_bytes` and reuses its
mechanism in `gc::worktree_size_cache`: `clud gc list` prints a stderr warning from a bounded,
early-exit walk, and the daemon's maintenance sweep thread (after the age sweep, skipped on
`Defer`) writes `~/.clud/tmp-size.json`, a sibling of `tmp` so the sweep never sees it. At launch
`tmp_launch_warning` reads only that file and a lock-free settings peek, with the same
`banner_decision` table (stale after 6 h, quiet on unknown). **Warn-only:** nothing is deleted
for size; the 72 h age sweep stays the only deleter of session temp
([DD-141](../DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#dd-141-session-temp-size-is-reported-never-a-deletion-trigger)).

**Forensic session state (#1014).** Every launch leaves a `<pid>__<start-epoch>/` directory under
`~/.clud/state/sessions/` holding the reaper's `reap.jsonl` / `reap-health.json` and, since #1011,
a `bridge.jsonl`. Nothing aged it out, so it accumulated one entry per session ever run — the
sibling `state/launches/` tree has been bounded by `MAX_RECORDS = 200` since #998. The entries are
tiny; the cost is directory-listing time and a tree nobody can search by hand during an incident.

Two windows, because the whole point of #998 and #1011 is that a failure trail survives to be read
afterwards. `crate::gc::session_state::classify` reads the directory's `bridge.jsonl` and calls it
**ambient** if every record is one the bridge wrote through `record_ambient` (`catalog_advertised`,
`admission_queued`, `admission_acquired`, `model_substituted` — see `AMBIENT_EVENTS`), **notable** otherwise. Ambient
directories go at 48h, notable ones at 30d. Anything unreadable, unparseable, or carrying an
unrecognized event counts as notable: drift and corruption both fail toward *keeping* the trail,
since deleting a forensic log on a parse guess is the only unrecoverable mistake available here.
`ambient_event_names_match_record_ambient_call_sites` fails if a new `record_ambient` event is
added without listing it.

A **live session's directory is never swept**, at any age — the reaper and the bridge write into it
for the whole life of the launch. Liveness is injected from `daemon/session_state_sweep.rs` rather
than called inside `gc::session_state`, which keeps the policy module free of process introspection
and its decision table unit-testable. A recycled PID can therefore keep one small directory alive
until that unrelated process exits; that is the safe direction and costs a few hundred bytes.

**Target reclamation (#510).** Opt-in: does nothing unless `CLUD_GC_TARGET_ROOTS` names one or
more dev roots (OS path-list separated). The sweep walks each root (bounded depth, skipping
`.git`/`node_modules`/`.claude` and not descending into a found `target/`), and removes `target/`
dirs — identified by a sibling `Cargo.toml` — whose mtime is older than
`CLUD_GC_TARGET_STALE_DAYS` (default 2). Default-off because reclaiming `target/` forces a
rebuild; the long mtime gate is the cheap stand-in for "no live build owns this."

**Background thread + prioritization.** The session-temp, session-state and target sweeps walk the filesystem
and can take a while, so the tick spawns them on a detached `clud-gc-sweep` thread rather than
blocking the registry tick loop; an `AtomicBool` guard prevents overlapping sweeps. Priority
(`maintenance_action` in `gc_service.rs`):

- **Disk low** — free space on the `~/.clud` volume or any target root below the watchdog warn
  threshold (`CLUD_GC_WARN_FREE_GB`): reclaim immediately, bypassing the sentinel throttle.
- **Otherwise** — only run when global CPU is under `CLUD_GC_SWEEP_MAX_CPU_PCT` (default 60%);
  if the box is busy, skip this cycle and let the next tick retry.

## Worktree scanner

`WorktreeScanner` (`crates/clud-bin/src/gc/scanner.rs`) is a polling thread spawned at clud startup
from `main.rs` via `WorktreeScanner::maybe_spawn*()`. It walks `<repo>/.claude/worktrees/`,
`<repo>/.extern-repos/`, and conservative sibling temp-clone names every ~2 seconds and sends
`gc.insert` IPC ops for matching immediate subdirs it sees. The scanner is
**insert-only**: rows that already exist are no-ops (`Registry::insert_if_new` at
`crates/clud-bin/src/gc/registry.rs`), so there is no per-cycle write churn.

Sleep is **chunked** — short 25ms sleeps add up to the ~2s polling interval, but remain cancellable
quickly — so Ctrl+C teardown does not block for two seconds waiting for the next iteration
(`crates/clud-bin/src/gc/scanner.rs`).

Cancellation is cooperative via `Arc<AtomicBool>`. `Drop` (`crates/clud-bin/src/gc/scanner.rs`) joins
the thread; the startup-side guard `_scanner_guard` in `main.rs` triggers this on normal
shutdown.

If the daemon is unreachable, the scanner logs once (debug level, gated by
`CLUD_GC_SCANNER_VERBOSE`) and **stops trying for the rest of the session**. It does not retry
on a backoff. This is intentional: in single-user CI/dev contexts there's no daemon to contact,
and quiet failure is preferable to a 2s-per-cycle stream of error logs.

## `--clean-worktrees`

`--clean-worktrees` (`crates/clud-bin/src/worktrees.rs`) is **unrelated to the GC store**. It is
a one-shot CLI flag for cleaning up git worktrees in the current repo, with no `redb`
involvement.

It enumerates via `git worktree list --porcelain`, classifies each entry as
`clean / dirty / unpushed / no-upstream / branch-gone` (`crates/clud-bin/src/worktrees.rs:53`),
and removes those that are *safe* — clean AND (older than `--stale-after` OR upstream `[gone]`).
`--force` widens the safe set to include `dirty` and `unpushed`.

Locked worktrees with fresh live/unknown/dead lock reasons are skipped. Once a lock exceeds
`CLUD_GC_LOCKED_HARD_AGE_DAYS` (default 7), `--clean-worktrees` presumes it is orphaned and lets
the entry pass through the same clean/dirty/unpushed/no-upstream/force rules as an unlocked
worktree. `--dry-run` is a faithful preview: nothing is mutated until the actual verified
worktree removal path.

**Shared landing verdict (#1606).** Ancestry cannot see a squash merge (DD-122), so before its
own rules the CLI runs the daemon's probe and `repo_worktree_verdict` for every worktree of the
repo (`crates/clud-bin/src/worktrees_verdict.rs`, through the bridge
`crates/clud-bin/src/daemon/gc_service/repo_worktree_cli.rs`), with one `gh pr list` per repo
and the patch-match fallback when `gh` is unavailable. Precedence, first match wins:

| condition | action |
|-----------|--------|
| lock too fresh for the hard-age gate | skip, as before |
| verdict `reclaimable` and ancestry status not `dirty` | remove via the daemon executor, reason = verdict reason (no `--force` needed) |
| any other verdict, ancestry skips | skip, reason gains `; verdict: <reason>` |
| any other verdict, or no probe row | the ancestry action, unchanged |

So the verdict only adds removals backed by positive evidence (merged PR covering the tip, patch
match, abandoned-empty under `~/.clud/tmp-wt`); every spare verdict (`dirty`, `untracked`,
`open PR #N`, `commits after merge`, `no PR`, `locked by live pid`, `process inside`, `detached`,
`main checkout`, `unverifiable`, ...) leaves `--force`, `--stale-after` and the lock rules exactly
as documented above. Verdict-backed removals go through `run_reclaim_with`
([reclaim](#repo-worktrees-squash-aware-verdict-1591-and-reclaim-1603)): fresh re-probe with an
unchanged verdict and tip, `git worktree remove` never `--force`, `branch -D` only at the verified
tip, prune, never a remote delete. A veto at that re-check is reported as `skipped (verdict
changed before removal: ...)`, not a failure. `--dry-run` prints the same plan, verdict and
reason; the status table shows `[state: reason]` per worktree.

**Verdict deadline (#1648, DD-130).** The verdict phase is bounded: a repo with only its main
checkout skips it entirely (no process table, no `gh`); otherwise `spawn_cli_probe` gathers rows
on a worker thread (one process-table snapshot, at most one `gh pr list` with a 3 s timeout and
only if some worktree reaches the PR check, git probes one worktree at a time) and streams them
back. `plan_in` waits at most `VERDICT_DEADLINE` (4 s) in total. A worktree whose row has not
arrived keeps the ancestry decision via `decide_verdict_timed_out`: a skip gains `; verdict timed
out`, an ignore becomes `skip (verdict timed out)`, and an ancestry removal stays as it was before
#1606. A missing verdict never produces a verdict-backed removal. `--dry-run` goes through the same
path, so it shows the timeout reason a real run would act on.

**No lock against a running daemon.** The per-repo reclaim lock (#1632, DD-125) serializes daemon
pool threads only. The CLI does not take it: its re-probe turns a worktree the daemon already
reclaimed into a skip (`gone from git worktree list`), and a simultaneous git step contends on
git's own `.lock` files and fails without forcing anything (DD-129).

The GC daemon also borrows `parse_worktree_porcelain` and the "extract pid from locked-reason"
helper from this module to compute the `live_locked` flag on `gc.list` output.

## Key types

Session cap:

- `SessionRegistry` (`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:358`) — open redb handle plus
  own-pid + liveness probe.
- `CapConfig`, `CapDecision` (`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:171`,
  `crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:191`) — pure cap-check inputs/outputs.
- `SessionInfo`, `SessionRow` (`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:206`,
  `crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:103`) — public + on-disk row shapes.
- `LockGuard` (`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:602`) — RAII for `sessions.lock`.

GC store / daemon:

- `Registry` (`crates/clud-bin/src/gc/registry.rs`) — owns the redb handle inside the daemon's
  registry-worker thread.
- `TrackedEntry`, `InsertInput` (`crates/clud-bin/src/gc/registry.rs`) — public row + insert-input
  shapes.
- `WorktreeScanner` (`crates/clud-bin/src/gc/scanner.rs`) — polling thread that talks IPC to the
  daemon.
- `DaemonInfo` (`crates/clud-bin/src/daemon/types.rs`) — info-file shape (pid + port) shared
  with the session-management half of the daemon.
- `ListRow` (`crates/clud-bin/src/daemon/types.rs`) — public JSON row shape returned by
  `gc.list` and serialized by `clud gc list --json`.
- `GcOp`, `GcReply` (`crates/clud-bin/src/daemon/types.rs`) — IPC payload enums carried inside
  `DaemonRequest::Gc` / `DaemonResponse::Gc`. `GcReply::PurgeOk { removed, skipped }` is the
  synchronous outcome (dry-run + DeleteById); `GcReply::PurgeStarted { dispatched, skipped }`
  is the bulk-purge fan-out outcome.
- `RegistryMsg`, `GcRequestMsg`, `PurgeCompletion`, `PurgeJob` (`crates/clud-bin/src/daemon/gc_service.rs`)
  — the worker's internal mpsc carries both client ops (`RegistryMsg::Op(GcRequestMsg)`) and
  fire-and-forget purge-pool callbacks (`RegistryMsg::PurgeCompletion`). The pool's job queue
  is `mpsc::Sender<PurgeJob>`.

`--clean-worktrees`:

- `WorktreeEntry`, `WorktreeStatus` (`crates/clud-bin/src/worktrees.rs:30`,
  `crates/clud-bin/src/worktrees.rs:53`).
- `CleanOptions` (`crates/clud-bin/src/worktrees.rs:91`).

## Failure modes

- **Daemon crash mid-request.** Client's TCP `read_line` returns 0 bytes; `gc_client_*`
  surfaces as `io::Error`. CLI prints `error: <op> failed: <msg>` and exits 1. The next
  `ensure_daemon()` from any clud process re-spawns the daemon. The worker's
  `recv_timeout(WORKER_REPLY_TIMEOUT)` in `dispatch_gc_op`
  (`crates/clud-bin/src/daemon/server.rs`) prevents a wedged worker from hanging the accept
  thread indefinitely.

- **Bringup race.** Two `clud` startups call `ensure_daemon()` simultaneously. Both see no
  daemon. Both try to acquire `daemon.lock`. The winner spawns; the loser blocks, then
  re-probes under the lock, finds the daemon, and returns. Issue #138.

- **`sessions.redb` lock contention.** N concurrent `clud` launches serialize on `sessions.lock`,
  never on the redb file lock. The lock is held for ~ms per launch; even hundreds of
  simultaneous spawns drain in well under a second on the host.

- **`sessions.redb` corruption.** `Database::create` returns a `redb::DatabaseError`;
  `run_startup_under_lock` surfaces it; `main.rs` logs and skips the cap check rather than
  refusing to launch (the cap is best-effort safety, not a hard requirement). The user can `rm`
  the file to recover.

- **Scanner thread panic.** The scanner thread is independent of the main launch path; a panic
  logs to stderr but does not affect the running session. `Drop::cancel` joins, so a panic in
  the worker also won't leak the thread.

- **Worktree dir gone mid-scan.** `read_dir` returns `NotFound` → `scan_once_via_ipc` treats as
  empty (`crates/clud-bin/src/gc/reconcile.rs`). Individual `agent-*` dirs disappearing between
  `read_dir` and the `gc.insert` IPC are benign: the daemon will accept the insert, and a future
  `gc prune`, explicit `gc purge --kind`, or a `git worktree remove` from outside clud cleans
  the row.

- **PID reuse.** The session-cap registry's `Drop` only deletes its row if `register_self` was
  called successfully (`crates/clud-bin/src/session_registry.rs:565`), so an early-aborted `clud`
  cannot clobber a sibling that happened to inherit its PID via POSIX PID reuse. `unregister`
  clears the flag too, for the same reason.

- **`--no-daemon`.** All `clud gc *` subcommands exit 2 with "gc
  operations require the clud daemon; remove --no-daemon". The scanner's IPC fails silently
  and the thread idles for the rest of the session. The session cap is unaffected (it doesn't
  use the daemon). The always-on auto-spawn from `main.rs` is also skipped.
