# Loop Subsystem

`clud loop <task>` runs the backend agent repeatedly against the same task
until either (a) the agent writes a `DONE` or `BLOCKED` marker file under
`<git-root>/.clud/loop/`, (b) the agent emits a `<<<CLUD_LOOP_DONE: ...>>>`
fallback token on stdout (subprocess + Claude mode only), or (c) the
configured iteration budget is exhausted. The subsystem is split across
`command::builder` (plan + prompt assembly), `loop_spec` (task-spec
resolution and marker contract), `loop_artifacts` (durable on-disk artifacts),
`loop_check` (post-iteration polling), `stream_json` (subprocess progress
rendering for Claude), and `runner` (the actual per-iteration spawn loop).
The `--repeat <duration>` variant takes a different path: it disables
the marker contract entirely and hands the plan to the daemon worker
(`daemon/worker.rs`) for cron-style re-invocation.

`/clud-loop` is the Codex-facing skill polyfill for Claude-style `/loop`.
Codex does not document arbitrary top-level custom slash-command registration,
so clud ships a `clud-loop` skill. The skill keeps durable work in
`.clud/loop/LOOP.md`; interval mode starts `clud --codex loop --repeat
<duration> --loop-count 1 --no-done .clud/loop/LOOP.md`, while no-interval
mode asks Codex to delegate the foreground `clud --codex loop
.clud/loop/LOOP.md` work to a worker subagent when available.

## Component map

- `command/builder.rs` — `build_launch_plan` (line 24) builds the prompt,
  injects the marker contract, parses `--repeat`, decides launch mode.
- `command/loop_task.rs` — `resolve_loop_task` (line 29) classifies the
  positional, fetches/caches GH issues, returns prompt text.
- `command/types.rs` — `LaunchPlan` (line 6) with `loop_markers`,
  `repeat_schedule`, `stream_json_progress` fields.
- `loop_spec.rs` — `TaskSpec` (line 41), `classify` (line 80),
  `done_marker_contract`, `scan_completion_token` (line 557),
  `read_markers_or_token` (line 596).
- `loop_artifacts.rs` — `TaskInfo` (line 50), `LoopSession` driver,
  `ensure_loop_in_gitignore`, `materialize_working_copy`.
- `loop_check.rs` — `check_loop_markers` (line 13, PTY/file-only),
  `check_loop_markers_with_output` (line 24, subprocess + token scan),
  `loop_unconverged_exit` (line 64).
- `stream_json.rs` — `render_line` turns one Claude stream-json event into
  one human-readable progress line.
- `runner.rs` — `run_plan_subprocess` (line 109) and `run_plan_pty`
  (line 415): the actual iteration loops.
- `daemon/worker.rs` — `run_repeat_worker` (line 171) for the
  `--repeat`-as-cron path inside the daemon.

## Lifecycle (one iteration)

1. User runs `clud loop <task>` (optional `--loop-count N`, `--done <path>`,
   `--no-done`, `--refresh`, `--repeat <dur>`).
2. `args.rs` parses the subcommand; `main.rs` calls
   `command::build_launch_plan`.
3. `build_launch_plan` resolves git root (`loop_spec::git_root_from`),
   resolves marker paths (`resolve_marker_paths`), calls
   `resolve_loop_task` to materialize the prompt body, appends
   `done_marker_contract(done_abs, blocked_abs)` (skipped if `--no-done`
   or `--repeat` is set without an explicit `--done`).
4. For Claude in subprocess mode with `loop`, the builder splices
   `--output-format stream-json --verbose` in front of `-p` so the runner
   can render live progress (`builder.rs:200`).
5. `main.rs` constructs a `loop_artifacts::LoopSession`, calls
   `ensure_loop_in_gitignore` and `materialize_working_copy`, then hands
   the plan to `runner::run_plan_subprocess` or `runner::run_plan_pty`.
6. The runner clears stale markers, then per iteration `N` (1-indexed):
   - Logs `[clud] iteration N/total` to stderr.
   - `LoopSession::on_iteration_start(N)` updates `info.json` and writes
     `motivation.md` on `N >= 2`.
   - Spawns the backend (subprocess via `running-process-core`, or PTY
     via `NativePtyProcess`).
   - On subprocess + stream-json: drains stdout through
     `stream_json::render_line`, accumulating raw output for the token
     fallback (`runner.rs:349`).
   - On PTY: pumps stdin/stdout via `session::run_raw_pty_pump_*`.
   - `LoopSession::on_iteration_end(N, rc, err)` flushes `info.json`.
   - `check_loop_markers(_with_output)` polls the marker files (and, in
     subprocess mode, scans captured output for the token). On `DONE`
     returns `0`; on `BLOCKED` returns `3`; otherwise continues.
7. After the budget is exhausted, `loop_unconverged_exit` returns `2` and
   prints a diagnostic block listing the expected marker paths plus the
   actual contents of `.clud/loop/`.

## Task-spec resolution

`loop_spec::classify` (line 80) tries, in order: GH issue/PR URL
(`https://github.com/owner/repo/{issues,pull}/N`), short-form (`#42` or
`42`), local file path, otherwise literal prompt. GH URLs and short-forms
flow into `fetch_via_gh` (`gh issue/pr view --json ...`); short-form
additionally calls `gh repo view` to discover owner/repo. Results are
cached under `<git-root>/.clud/loop/<owner>__<repo>__{issue,pull}-N.md`
with a YAML frontmatter (`url`, `fetched_at`, `updated_at`). Subsequent
runs reuse the cache unless `--refresh` is passed. Literal prompts and
file paths are also mirrored under the loop dir by
`loop_artifacts::materialize_working_copy` (literal → `LOOP.md`, file →
`<original-filename>`), with skip-if-exists semantics so user edits
survive across iterations.

## DONE/BLOCKED contract

`loop_spec::done_marker_contract(done_abs, blocked_abs)` returns a fixed
text block appended to the prompt body when marker injection is active.
It instructs the agent to write the **exact absolute** path on completion
(issue #95: relative paths led agents to invent `~/.loop/LOOP.md` and
similar). The default paths are `<git-root>/.clud/loop/DONE` and
`<git-root>/.clud/loop/BLOCKED`; `--done <path>` overrides DONE, and the
BLOCKED path is derived via `blocked_path_from_done` (`DONE.md` →
`BLOCKED.md`).

The contract also documents a token fallback for agents that cannot
write files: a line that starts with `<<<CLUD_LOOP_DONE:` and ends with
`>>>`. `scan_completion_token` (`loop_spec.rs:557`) parses captured
stdout for the LAST such token; the marker file always wins if both are
present. Token scanning is only wired in the subprocess path because PTY
mode never sees the child's bytes — they go straight to the user's
terminal.

After each iteration, the runner calls `loop_check::check_loop_markers`
(PTY) or `check_loop_markers_with_output` (subprocess). Marker poll is
synchronous and happens once per iteration boundary; there is no
in-flight watcher.

## Artifacts

Everything durable lives under `<git-root>/.clud/loop/`:

- `info.json` — `TaskInfo` (`loop_artifacts.rs:50`): `start_time`,
  `end_time`, `total_iterations`, `current_iteration`, `completed`,
  `error`, and a `Vec<IterationInfo>` with per-iteration
  `start_time`/`end_time`/`exit_code`/`error`. Flushed at
  iteration-start, iteration-end, and loop-end via `LoopSession`.
- `log.txt` — append-only text log of `=== loop start ===`,
  `=== iteration N start ===`, `=== iteration N end rc=X ===`, and
  `=== loop end <summary> ===` lines. Best-effort; never aborts on
  write failure.
- `motivation.md` — fixed prompt fragment written on iteration `>= 2`
  to anchor the agent in continuation mode.
- `LOOP.md` / `<task-file-name>` — working copy of the literal/file
  task spec; skip-if-exists.
- `<owner>__<repo>__{issue,pull}-N.md` — GH fetch cache.
- `DONE` / `BLOCKED` — marker files written by the agent (or, with
  `--done <path>`, wherever the user pointed).

`ensure_loop_in_gitignore` appends `.clud/loop` to an existing
`<git-root>/.gitignore` (and warns to stderr) if no covering entry is
already present. It does **not** create `.gitignore` if missing.

## stream-json rendering

Wired only when `backend == Claude && Command::Loop && launch_mode ==
Subprocess` (`builder.rs:200`). The builder splices
`--output-format stream-json --verbose` in front of `-p`, sets
`plan.stream_json_progress = true`, and the runner switches to
`run_with_stream_json_renderer` (`runner.rs:349`). Each captured stdout
line goes through `stream_json::render_line`, which returns one
human-readable line per `system/assistant/result` event (tool uses,
assistant prose, session start). Unknown events drop silently;
non-JSON lines pass through verbatim. The raw bytes are also
accumulated into `captured_output` so the token fallback still works.

PTY mode skips all of this — Claude already renders its own live TUI
into the user's terminal.

## --repeat scheduling

`parse_repeat_interval` (`builder.rs:250`) accepts `30s`, `5m`, `1h`,
`24h` (rejects zero, fractional, negative, compound, and unknown
units). When `--repeat` is set without `--done` and without
`--no-done`, `repeat_implies_no_done_warning` (`builder.rs:290`) prints
a warning and the DONE contract is omitted.

`next_run_at_millis(completed_at_millis, interval_secs)`
(`builder.rs:316`) computes the next fire time as
`completed_at + interval`, **not** `started_at + interval`. This is the
no-overlap invariant: if a run takes longer than the interval, the next
run is pushed out — runs serialize and never stack.

The actual scheduling loop lives in the daemon worker
(`daemon/worker.rs:171`, `run_repeat_worker`): per cycle it sets
`repeat_running = true`, calls `run_repeat_once`, then sets
`repeat_running = false` with `repeat_next_run_at` populated and sleeps
in 250 ms ticks until that wall-clock instant, checking each tick that
the daemon is still alive. Each `run_repeat_once`
(`daemon/worker.rs:253`) spawns the child with
`creationflags = invisible_helper_creationflags()` (no conhost popup on
Windows) and `Containment::Contained` (kill-on-close Job Object). Output
is captured into a TCP-broadcast log, not the user's terminal.

## Key types

- `LoopMarkers { done_path: String, blocked_path: String }` —
  `command/types.rs:28`
- `RepeatSchedule { interval_secs: u64 }` — `command/types.rs:34`
- `LaunchPlan` (carries `loop_markers`, `repeat_schedule`,
  `stream_json_progress`) — `command/types.rs:6`
- `TaskSpec` enum (`GhIssue` / `ShortForm` / `File` / `Literal`) —
  `loop_spec.rs:41`
- `TaskInfo` + `IterationInfo` — `loop_artifacts.rs:50`,
  `loop_artifacts.rs:80`
- `LoopSession` (iteration-boundary driver) — `loop_artifacts.rs:168`
- `build_launch_plan` — `command/builder.rs:24`
- `next_run_at_millis` (no-overlap scheduler) —
  `command/builder.rs:316`
- `scan_completion_token` (token fallback) — `loop_spec.rs:557`
- `read_markers_or_token` (file-wins-over-token resolver) —
  `loop_spec.rs:596`
- `check_loop_markers` / `check_loop_markers_with_output` /
  `loop_unconverged_exit` — `loop_check.rs:13`, `:24`, `:64`
- Iteration loop entry: `run_plan_subprocess` (`runner.rs:109`) and
  `run_plan_pty` (`runner.rs:415`)
- Repeat-mode entry: `run_repeat_worker` (`daemon/worker.rs:171`)

## Failure modes

- **GH fetch failure** — `fetch_and_cache_or_die`
  (`command/loop_task.rs:59`) prints `error: failed to fetch GH ...`
  and `std::process::exit(1)` from inside `build_launch_plan`. No loop
  artifacts are created.
- **Short-form without `gh` repo context** — `resolve_current_repo`
  fails; same `exit(1)` path.
- **Marker file unwritable** — All `loop_artifacts` writes
  (`info.json`, `log.txt`, `motivation.md`, `.gitignore` append) are
  best-effort: IO errors are swallowed and the loop continues. The
  agent's own DONE/BLOCKED write going EACCES is invisible to clud —
  the loop will run to its iteration cap and exit `2` (unconverged).
- **Child crash mid-iteration** — runner records the non-zero exit
  via `LoopSession::on_iteration_end` and (if `plan.iterations > 1`)
  returns that exit code immediately rather than continuing. The
  next-iteration spawn is **not** attempted on a non-zero exit.
- **Ctrl+C mid-iteration** — `interrupted: &AtomicBool` is checked at
  the top of every iteration and inside both stdio drain loops. On
  trip: subprocess mode runs `teardown_interrupted_child` (Ctrl+Break,
  then `process_tree::kill_tree`, then `process.kill()`+2 s wait); PTY
  mode lets `session::run_raw_pty_pump_*` tear down. Final exit code
  is `130`, and `LoopSession::on_iteration_end(N, 130, Some("Interrupted by user"))`
  is recorded.
- **Repeat overlap** — structurally impossible: `run_repeat_worker`
  schedules off `completed_at`, not `started_at`. A slow run delays
  the next run; it cannot trigger a concurrent one.
- **Agent invents a completion filename** — `loop_unconverged_exit`
  (`loop_check.rs:64`) prints the expected absolute paths plus the
  actual contents of `.clud/loop/`, calling out stray `*.md` files
  that aren't `DONE.md`/`BLOCKED.md` so the user sees why the loop
  didn't converge.
