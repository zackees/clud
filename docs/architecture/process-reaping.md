# Process reaping

How clud cleans up processes it left behind, and — more importantly — how it
decides what it must **not** touch.

Reaping spans `job_orphan_reaper.rs`, `orphan_reaper.rs`, `process_scan.rs`,
`process_tree.rs`, `process_identity.rs`, `reap_log.rs`, `daemon/proc_sampler.rs`
and the `running-process` boundary, so the cross-directory story lives here and
the per-directory READMEs link in.

Rationale for the non-obvious choices: [DD-021], [DD-023], [DD-024].

## The two reapers are disjoint

They look like duplicates. They are not, and misreading them produces a false
safety argument — one was made during #673's own review.

| | `job_orphan_reaper` (Windows) | `orphan_reaper` (cross-platform) |
|---|---|---|
| **Selects by** | Job Object membership + a role classification of the process tree | inherited `RUNNING_PROCESS_ORIGINATOR=CLUD:<pid>` tag |
| **Catches** | leaks of a **live** clud — a tool shell exited and left a client running | orphans of a **dead** clud — the session that spawned them is gone |
| **Runs** | continuously, off a completion port, at up to 5 Hz | at foreground exit, on `clud slay`, and on the daemon's periodic sweep |
| **Key filter** | the trigger shell's exit | `!parent_alive` (`orphan_reaper.rs`) |

The daemon's periodic sweep filters `!p.parent_alive`, so it sees **only**
orphans whose originating clud is dead. The job reaper exists precisely for
leaks of a clud that is still running. **The two sets are disjoint by
construction**, which is why neither can serve as the other's backstop — and why
the job reaper needs its own retry-at-exit list for exits it abandons
(#673 Phase 2d).

---

## The `(pid, creation_time)` keyspace

A bare PID is not a stable handle. Windows reissues numbers promptly, so "the
PID is alive" and "that process is alive" are different questions
(`process_identity.rs`). Every per-process cache, set and log in the reaping
subsystem is therefore keyed by `ProcessIdentity { pid, start_time }`.

Two populations, because a key can be born incomplete:

- **Keyed entries** — a full `(pid, creation_time)`. Purged by the single sweep
  once the process is confirmed gone and its grace window has elapsed.
- **Unkeyable entries** — the process died before a creation time could be read.
  No amount of retrying will produce a key, so they get a **hard TTL and a hard
  cap** rather than an eviction rule tied to liveness.

**One purge sweep** (`TrackerProcesses::purge`) evicts everything together:
`known`, `processed_exits`, `provisional_empty_exits`, the retry counters, the
deferral timestamps and the unkeyable pen. Two invariants govern it:

- *Never evict an interior dead node that still has a live descendant.* The
  planner walks `parent_pid` links **through** `known`, so removing an interior
  node disconnects — and silently stops reaping — its whole subtree.
- *Never evict a companion before `known`.* Dropping `processed_exits[(pid, st)]`
  while a dead `known[pid]` survives makes `pending_exit_pids` resurrect the
  identity and re-finalize it forever.

Every kill re-verifies the identity immediately before acting — **every**
target, root and descendant alike. Between the scan that selects a target and
the kill that acts, a PID can die and be recycled, and killing a *tree* takes
the replacement's children with it. `TopologySnapshot::kill_tree_filtered` used
to re-check only the root and then kill descendants straight from the snapshot
on a bare PID; #688 closed that, generalizing what Windows'
`kill_tree_filtered_automatic` already did.

---

## Daemon-sparing: OS signals first, marker second, whitelist last

A clud session must never kill a daemon started inside it. Which daemon it is
does not matter; **how it detached** does.

Every signal sits behind the `ProcessFacts` trait, is collected once per pass
into a `FactsSnapshot`, and is then consulted as pure data. No reap-decision
code calls Win32 — see [DD-024]. The trait, the precedence order and the
per-platform producers live in `reaper_facts.rs`.

### Which reaper consults the table

**Both of them, and that is new.** #673 Phase 1a landed the table inside
`job_orphan_reaper`, so for a while only the Windows tool-shell reaper had it.
`orphan_reaper` — the cross-platform one, with the wider blast radius — still
spared by the cooperative marker alone. Net effect: an sccache-shaped daemon
survived the tool shell that started it and was then killed at clud's own exit,
by `clud slay`, or by the daemon's periodic sweep. #688 moved the table into
`reaper_facts.rs` and wired the second consumer.

| Consumer | Entry points | Signals it can answer |
|---|---|---|
| `job_orphan_reaper` (Windows) | tool-shell exit, runtime reconcile, exit sweep | all seven — it owns the Job Object handle, so row 1 is available |
| `orphan_reaper` (cross-platform) | foreground `clud` exit, `clud slay`, daemon `ReapOrphans` + periodic sweep | rows 2–7; **row 1 is reported unavailable**, because there is no job on this path |

Row 1 being *unavailable* rather than answered "inside the job" is load-bearing:
answering it would read as a positive finding of containment for every candidate.

The spare decision carries a **reason**, and `ReapOutcome::spared` surfaces it
to the caller. "The daemon survived" is not the property worth asserting — a
reaper that never saw the process at all also leaves it running.

### Precedence

| # | Signal | Windows | POSIX | Catches |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Job-object membership** | `IsProcessInJob` — false ⇒ broke away | — | anything using `spawn_daemon_breaking_away_from_job`; cheapest and strongest, we already own the job handle |
| 2 | **Session / service context** | `ProcessIdToSessionId` == 0 ⇒ service | — | **dockerd** / Docker Desktop |
| 3 | **Session leader** | — | `getsid(pid) != getsid(0)` ⇒ `setsid()` | double-fork daemons, language servers |
| 4 | **Token owner** | process cannot be opened for termination | `euid` differs | services; also cases where the kill would fail anyway |
| 5 | **Declared daemon** | `RUNNING_PROCESS_IS_DAEMON` | same | **zccache**, **soldr** — everything that opted in |
| 6 | **Listening endpoint** | `GetExtendedTcpTable` over `AF_INET` **and** `AF_INET6` | `/proc/net/tcp{,6}` + `/proc/net/unix`, matched to `/proc/<pid>/fd` | **sccache**, **FBuildWorker**, language servers |
| 7 | **Interactive desktop root** | visible non-tool top-level window in the current interactive session | unavailable | protects its whole user-facing process family |
| 8 | **Docker Desktop family** | `Docker Desktop.exe` / `com.docker.*` roots | same | Docker Desktop backend plus its WSL runtime subtree (#773) |
| 9 | **Configured spare-list** | `CLUD_REAPER_SPARE_IMAGES` | same | operator escape hatch; ships empty |

Cheap and authoritative first, expensive last. 1–4 are one syscall each and no
memory read, and every PID they rule out is a PID whose environment is never
touched. 6 is evaluated only for what survives them.

Known gap: **Windows named pipes**. Windows exposes no documented
pipe-name-to-owning-PID mapping, so a daemon whose only endpoint is a named pipe
still needs the marker or the operator spare-list. The POSIX analogue is
covered — `/proc/net/unix` is read alongside the TCP tables.

The interactive-desktop signal is deliberately narrower than arbitrary GUI or
console attachment: the one-pass Win32 enumeration accepts only visible,
non-tool top-level windows in the current interactive session. A spared root is
expanded through the sweep's topology snapshot before any candidate is killed,
so versioned helper images (for example plugin hosts) survive as a family rather
than through a brittle image-name allowlist.

Coverage is not uniform across platforms, and the table says so rather than
guessing: on macOS only rows 3 and 5 are answerable without linking a
platform-specific process-inspection library, so rows 2, 4 and 6 are reported
unavailable there.

A signal the platform cannot answer is recorded as **unavailable** and never
spares. Absence of evidence is not evidence of daemon-hood — that inversion is
exactly what #522 fixed.

**Console attachment is deliberately unranked.** Once the trigger shell exits
its console goes with it, which makes "no console" indistinguishable between a
detached daemon and an ordinary leaked client. It would over-spare precisely
when it is consulted.

A whitelist is a **last resort and must be data, not code**. The one deliberate
exception is Docker Desktop's narrowly identified product family (#773): its
backend is user-session scoped and commonly exposes only a Windows named pipe,
so none of the generic service signals can prove that it and its WSL subtree
belong to a durable engine. The reaper spares only the official UI/backend
roots (`Docker Desktop.exe` and `com.docker.*`), then its existing prune rule
keeps their descendants intact; it does not spare the ordinary `docker.exe`
client.

### The cooperative-marker caveat

> **`RUNNING_PROCESS_IS_DAEMON` is set by *other programs*, not by clud.
> Grepping this repo tells you nothing about the runtime set.**

`running_process::spawn::spawn_daemon_inner` applies the marker to every
daemon-spawn variant, and its own comment names the consumers: *"including the
free functions consumers like **zccache** call directly"*. On a soldr/zccache
machine the set is non-empty, and its members are exactly the processes that
must never be reaped.

Known setters: **zccache**, **soldr / `soldr-daemon`**.
Known non-setters: **sccache**, **dockerd**, **`FBuildWorker`**, language
servers.

This is why the marker ranks *below* every OS signal: opting in is optional, so
the marker is a bonus, never the only line of defence. See [DD-023] for the
reversal this records.

## One host scan per drain, not per notification

The environment pass below is the *most* expensive enumeration, but it is not
the only one. Classifying a `NEW_PROCESS` notification needs the notifying
PID's parent and image name, and the only source for those is
`CreateToolhelp32Snapshot` — a **full enumeration of every process on the
host**, ~20 ms on a 500-process box.

The listener used to take one such enumeration *per completion-port message*,
to look up exactly one PID. Under agent tool-call churn — measured at **~178
process spawns/second**, overwhelmingly short-lived `bash.exe` — that is ~3.6
cores of kernel time in a single session. Worse, the cost is
`O(all processes on the host)` while each concurrent session *adds* to that
count, so N sessions cost more than N times one session (#706).

The rule now:

- **Drain first, then classify.** After the blocking wait returns one message,
  the listener drains everything already queued with a **zero** timeout. The
  drain adds no latency — it collects only what is already there — and it is
  bounded by `MAX_DRAIN_BATCH` so a runaway spawner cannot starve the `stop`
  check.
- **One host enumeration per batch, taken lazily.** `BatchTable` reads the
  process table at most once per drain, and only if some message in the batch
  actually needs it. A batch of exits for already-resolved PIDs never touches
  Toolhelp at all.
- **One reconcile pass per batch.** `batch_needs_reconcile` lives in `model`,
  not in the Win32 listener, so the folding rule is unit-tested on every
  platform. Folding is safe because a pass re-plans the *entire* pending set;
  `ACTIVE_PROCESS_ZERO` is the one message that cancels it, because the reset
  empties the backlog — and a later message in the same batch re-arms it.

Measured on a 48-process burst: **5 host scans instead of ~48**, with 36
messages folded into the largest drain. The win grows with churn, because
heavier load means deeper queues and therefore bigger batches.

`ReapCounters::host_scans` and `peak_batch` make this readable at exit.
`host_scans` is incremented inside `snapshot()` itself, so it counts **every**
enumeration: the batch path, `register_backend`, the exit sweep, and the
quiet-period retry in `retry_unresolved_new_processes`.

That last one matters and is why the counter is not call-site-scoped. It fires
on the 200 ms timeout whenever a PID is still unresolved, so it is the one
recurring host scan the batching does *not* remove. It is self-limiting rather
than permanent — `MAX_METADATA_RETRIES` bounds each PID to 10 quiet periods, so
the set drains in ~2 s — but it is real, and counting only the batch path (as
this first shipped) hid it.

**`host_scans` is therefore not bounded by `ticks`**: one tick can drive both a
retry scan and a batch scan. The bound that holds is against the *message*
count — a burst of N messages must not cost N enumerations — which is what
`reaper_batch_drain_windows` asserts and what `peak_batch` explains.

*Per-PID creation time is deliberately not folded into the batch read.*
`process_identity::start_time_of` is an `OpenProcess` + `GetProcessTimes` —
microseconds, and unlike the shared table it cannot be stale.

---

## One environment pass

Reading a process's environment block means a `ReadProcessMemory` walk of its
PEB — the most expensive enumeration on the machine. Two rules keep it bounded:

- **`process_scan::scan_env` answers both env questions from one snapshot** —
  the originator-tagged set (additive: kill targets) and the declared-daemon set
  (subtractive: spares). Asking `running-process` for them cost two full-host
  passes back to back.
- **`process_scan::DaemonMarkerCache` reads each identity's environment once,
  ever**, over a *bounded candidate set* — the reaper's own job membership,
  never the host.

**Subtractive data may be stale; additive data may not.** A stale spare-list
spares too much, which is harmless. A stale *kill-target enrollment* names a
process that must not be killed. Never build the analogous cache for the
additive side.

**Every map needs an eviction rule at the time it is introduced.** The marker
cache's is `retain_identities`, called every pass against the live candidate set.

---

## Observability

Reaping is destructive and used to be silent, which is how #651 could be closed
as fixed while the same symptom kept growing. `reap_log.rs` provides:

- `ReapCounters` — ticks, reconcile passes, environment blocks actually read,
  host process-table enumerations and peak drain batch (#706), peak `known` and
  peak backlog, plus the decision census. Printed at exit; `--verbose` adds the
  measurement line.
- `ReapLog` — one JSONL line per **mutation** at
  `~/.clud/state/sessions/<pid>__<epoch>/reap.jsonl`. Buffered, never flushed
  per event (#544 found per-op synchronous JSONL flushes to be an idle-CPU cost
  of their own), and nothing at all is written for a pass that changed nothing.
  Every recorded decision includes timestamp, PID, executable, immediate parent,
  rule/reason, action, and phase so a later incident can be attributed without
  inferring process lineage from a partial UI state (#773).

**Metadata misses go to the session log, never the shared one.** A job
notification for a PID Toolhelp could not resolve before it exited is *expected*
under process churn — the path fails closed and spares it. Enumerating each one
into `daemon-events.jsonl` synchronously ran at ~300 writes/min, made them 98.8%
of that log, and rotated every other producer's events (including the daemon's
own orphan-sweep status) out before anyone could read them (#689). Per-PID lines
now go to this session's buffered `reap.jsonl`; `ReapCounters::metadata_misses`
carries the total to the exit summary. The diagnostic is relocated and
summarized, not deleted.

Two reconciliation identities, checkable from the summary:

```
shell_exits_observed == finalized + abandoned + still_pending_at_exit
decisions_emitted    == reaped + spared
```

They stay separate, and `tracked` belongs to neither, because the populations
are disjoint: most spawned processes never become reap candidates; abandoned
identities are *triggers* while kill targets are their *descendants*; and a kill
takes a whole subtree without emitting a decision per descendant. `metadata_misses`
is outside both for the same reason: an unresolvable process never became a
candidate, so it emitted no decision.

When reading the log, check the **reason**, not only the outcome. A daemon
spared as `outside_job_object` or `listening_endpoint` was spared by a signal
the code evaluated. A daemon that never appears at all was spared by accident —
most likely because the plan produced nothing — and that will regress the next
time the planner changes.

## Where a reaper change gets tested

> **Prefer unit tests. They are faster and they run on every platform.** An
> integration test is justified only when the behaviour cannot be expressed
> against injected process facts — in practice, only when a real Job Object or
> real process detachment is the thing under test.

This is only possible because reap decisions take OS facts as **data**
([DD-024]). A change that calls Win32 inline silently forces itself into the
slow lane and out of cross-platform coverage.

- **Tier 1 — unit** (`job_orphan_reaper`'s `lifecycle_tests`, `orphan_reaper`'s
  and `reaper_facts`' test modules): the decision table. Synthetic process graphs
  plus a `FactsSnapshot` fixture. Assert **spare + reason**, never just the
  outcome. Every new daemon shape, precedence rule, negative case and
  state-bounding rule goes here.
- **Tier 2 — integration**: a real Job Object, a real breakaway, a real detached
  listener. **Budget: ≤5 tests per file.** Anything expressible in Tier 1 must be
  in Tier 1. Uses `testbins/daemon-stub`, never a real sccache/docker install.
  - `reaper_daemon_survival_windows.rs`, `tool_shell_lifecycle_windows.rs` — the
    job reaper's tool-shell-exit path.
  - `reaper_orphan_sweep_survival.rs` — the cross-platform reaper's `clud slay` /
    daemon-sweep path and its on-exit scan (#688). It drives
    `reap_orphans_filtered` with an admission closure narrowed to its own stub
    PIDs, so a full-host sweep on a developer's machine cannot reap somebody
    else's work; the hook runs before `report_and_reap`, so the code under test
    is exactly what `clud slay` executes.
- **Tier 3 — opt-in** (`bench/README.md` runbook): checking the stub's signal
  shapes against genuinely installed daemons on a developer box. Never gating.

Daemon-stub tests need raw `std::process::Command` and must be added to
`ci/banned_imports.py`'s exempt set with a rationale: `NativeProcess` would
attach its own containment *and set the very marker whose absence is under test*.
