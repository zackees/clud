"""Reject hand-rolled cross toolchains; soldr owns Apple / Windows-MSVC (#637, #714).

soldr owns the blessed cross surface for `*-apple-darwin` and
`*-pc-windows-msvc`: `soldr prepare --target ...` provisions the LLVM toolchain
and the vendored MSVC CRT, and `soldr build --target ...` links against it.
`cargo xwin` and `cargo zigbuild --target *-apple-darwin` remain *technically*
reachable, and soldr's own docs call them legacy passthroughs — which is exactly
the failure mode this lint exists to prevent. Beyond correctness there is a
throughput argument: `cargo xwin` re-downloads and splats the MSVC CRT/SDK on
every cold cache, minutes at a time, while `soldr prepare` fetches a prepared
sysroot.

**Zig stays legitimate for Linux.** `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` cross-builds
through `cargo-zigbuild`, and the manylinux wheel links through `maturin --zig`.

## Two rule classes, and why the split matters (#714)

Splitting the table is the whole point of #714. The original rule required a
*literal* Apple/MSVC triple on the same line as the tool, which is right for Zig
(the same command aimed at Linux is the supported path) and wrong for everything
else: `cargo xwin build --target $TARGET` names no literal triple, and neither
does `cargo xwin build --release`, yet `xwin` is an MSVC-only tool by
construction. Those now fail unconditionally.

    BANNED_ALWAYS            tools with no legitimate target in this repo —
                             cargo-xwin, the bare `xwin` CLI, osxcross, `cross`
    BANNED_AT_SOLDR_TARGET   tools that are correct for Linux and wrong for
                             Apple/MSVC — cargo-zigbuild, `maturin --zig`, zig cc
    BANNED_INSTALLS          acquiring any of the above, at any target: a
                             hand-installed wrapper is what makes a hand-rolled
                             invocation reachable in the first place

## What this catches, and what it cannot

This is a **textual** scan, so it catches the shape a regression actually takes:
a literal command in YAML, Python, shell, PowerShell, TOML, Rust or a
Dockerfile. Install patterns additionally run against the whole file, because
the shape that matters in GitHub Actions spans lines:

    - uses: taiki-e/install-action@v2
      with:
        tool: cargo-xwin

Before #714 those patterns were compiled with `re.MULTILINE` but matched
per-line, so they could never fire.

The one hole left is a *conditional* tool driven at a target held in a variable
(`cargo zigbuild --target $TARGET`, legal for Linux, illegal for Apple). That is
closed separately and more strongly by
`tests/test_ci_matrix.py::test_cross_argv_never_routes_apple_or_msvc_through_a_banned_tool`,
which calls the real `ci.xbuild.cargo_argv` for every target in the matrix and
asserts the argv it returns names no banned tool. Text scan for the shapes,
behavioural assertion for the dispatch — neither alone is enough.

    A scanner rather than a regex, because all three of the cheap regex
    approaches are wrong in a way that matters:

    * `/\\*.*?\\*/` stops at the first `*/`, but **Rust block comments nest**,
      so `/* /* */ cargo xwin build */` would leave live-looking text behind.
    * Splitting a line at `//` cuts strings containing `//` — a URL such as
      `"https://github.com/rust-cross/cargo-xwin"` is a real reference to the
      banned tool and must survive to be reported, and truncating there also
      hides whatever follows on the line.
    * Neither knows about string literals, so `let open = "/*";` … `let close
      = "*/";` would swallow every line between them. That is a one-line
      bypass for anyone who notices.

    Comment characters become spaces and newlines are preserved, so every
    offset and line number in the result matches the input exactly. The
    install patterns map a match offset back to a line number, so that
    property is load-bearing rather than incidental.

    Char literals are consumed as a unit, matched by shape rather than by a
    bare `'`: a lifetime (`&'a str`) opens a quote that never closes, so
    treating every `'` as a delimiter would desynchronise the scanner on
    ordinary Rust. The shape test is what makes `let q = '"';` safe — without
    it that lone quote flips the scanner's phase, and a following
    `"https://…/cargo-xwin"` is read as code whose `//` starts a comment,
    blanking the rest of the line. That is a *missed violation*, not the
    harmless over-reporting an earlier version of this docstring claimed, and
    four files in this repo were already desynced by it.

    Returns `(stripped, ended_clean)`. `ended_clean` is false when the scan
    finishes mid-string or mid-block-comment, which means the scanner lost
    sync with the source somewhere and everything after that point was read in
    the wrong state. That is the property worth asserting over real files:
    length and newline count are preserved *unconditionally* — the scanner
    only ever writes `" "`, and never at a newline — so a test that checks
    only those passes against a scanner that is desynced from the first line,
    which is exactly how the raw-string bug survived two review rounds.
