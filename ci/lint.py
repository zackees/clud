    `soldr cargo build` repopulates the read-only hardlinks on every build, so
    the condition is close to permanent in a soldr-driven tree -- while
    `fmt` does not compile anything and usually succeeds against it anyway.
    Predicting failure from it blocks lint runs that would have passed, which
    is worse than the confusing message this exists to explain.

        error: output file .../libserde_core-<hash>.rmeta is not writeable

    names whichever dependency compiled first, changes run to run, and reads
    as a permissions problem in your checkout rather than a toolchain-routing
    one. That cost three separate diagnoses in one session, and once let a
    formatter-dirty commit reach CI because the failure was read as
