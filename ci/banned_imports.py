    # trampoline.rs is exempt — it must use std::process::Command to re-exec

    # spawning), but the #[cfg(test)] tests deliberately use std::process::
    # Command to spawn fixture trees *without* Containment::Contained. Using
    # NativeProcess in those tests would attach a Job Object that already
    # kills descendants on close, masking whether kill_tree's own walk
    # actually works.
    # win32_hooking_probe.rs is exempt — #468 is a research-only ignored
    # integration test that deliberately constructs raw Win32 jobs, suspended
    # children, and injection targets. running-process containment would mask
    # exactly the primitives under measurement.
    #
    # clud_shim.rs is exempt — the shim's entire purpose is to `execvp`
    # (Unix) or `CreateProcess` (Windows) and replace itself with the
    # resolved Python interpreter. running-process's NativeProcess
    # always spawns under containment, which is precisely the wrong
    # semantics for a relay binary. See #406 / #409.
    #
    # ctrlc_signal_kinds.rs / ctrlc_windows_events.rs are exempt (#517) —
    # these tests send a real OS signal / console-control event to the
    # exact spawned pid (`libc::kill` / `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent`) and
    # assert on clud's captured interrupt reason. NativeProcess always
    # spawns under containment (a Windows Job Object), which is
    # irrelevant to what's under test and would only add noise.
    #
    # cpu_banner.rs is exempt (#540) — production code uses sysinfo (no
    # subprocess spawning), but the #[cfg(test)] #[ignore]d sampler-cost
    # bench deliberately uses std::process::Command to spawn a 55-process
    # fixture subtree, mirroring the process_tree.rs exemption.
    #
    # tool_shell_lifecycle_windows.rs is exempt (#616) — it must build raw
    # process trees inside the production foreground Job Object. NativeProcess
    # would add its own containment and mask the completion-port lifecycle.
    #
    # reaper_daemon_survival_windows.rs is exempt (#674) — the daemon-survival
    # suite must build raw process trees inside the production foreground Job
    # Object, and its sccache-shaped case turns on the *absence* of the
    # RUNNING_PROCESS_IS_DAEMON marker. NativeProcess would attach its own
    # containment and set that marker, erasing the signal under test.
    # reaper_orphan_sweep_survival.rs is exempt (#688) — the cross-platform
    # half of the same suite. Its sccache-shaped stub must detach on its own
    # and carry an inherited CLUD: originator tag *without* the daemon marker;
    # NativeProcess would set that marker and erase the signal under test.
    # reaper_batch_drain_windows.rs is exempt (#706) — the completion-port
    # drain test needs a burst of children to land in the *tracker's* job so
    # their notifications queue on its port. NativeProcess would attach its own
    # Job Object to each child, moving the notifications off the port under
    # test and leaving nothing to batch.
    #
    # process_identity.rs is exempt (#643) — one test
    # (`an_exited_process_is_dead_even_while_its_handle_remains_open`) must hold
    # the raw `std::process::Child` handle open *across* the liveness check.
    # On Windows an open handle keeps the PID reserved, which is precisely the
    # condition under test; NativeProcess manages its handle internally and does
    # not guarantee it survives `wait()`, so wrapping this would delete the
    # scenario rather than exercise it.
    # subprocess_capture_lifecycle_windows.rs is exempt (#634) — its compiled
    # fixture must spawn a descendant before any containment is attached. The
    # production side of the same test goes through ManagedSubprocess; using it
    # for the fixture would make the test green even if the race returned.
