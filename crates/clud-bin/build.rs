    // sidecar has to be provably the one for this binary. Version plus triple
    // identifies a release, not a build: a rebuilt or patched binary at the

    // is worse than not symbolicating at all because the wrong line numbers

    // emitting it -- `readelf -n` on a built binary showed only
    // `.note.ABI-tag`. The linker default is no build-id unless a distro
    // patches it in, so it has to be asked for.
    //
    // Gated to ELF: this is a GNU-ld/lld flag. MSVC's link.exe would reject
    // it, and Mach-O carries LC_UUID instead, which the Apple linker emits
    // without being asked.

    // and the `.dwp` / `.pdb` / `.dSYM` is per-triple. The wheel a user
    // installed does not otherwise record which one they got.

    // produced rather than the host's -- which is the whole point, since the
    // cross-built artifacts are the ones shipped.
