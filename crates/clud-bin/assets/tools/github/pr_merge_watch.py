"""pr_merge_watch.py — fail-fast PR-check waiter for clud.

Polls a GitHub PR's checks; returns the moment a required check fails,
new review activity arrives, the PR closes/merges, or the timeout fires.
On non-success exits (and defensively on success), cancels still-running
workflow runs on the PR's head SHA so we stop burning matrix minutes on
results we've already decided to ignore.

Invoked via `"$CLUD_EXE" tool run github/pr_merge_watch.py …` so UV_CACHE_DIR
is pinned to ~/.clud/cache/uv per the three-layer enforcement (see
issue #408).

Immediately announces a durable repo-local JSONL log under
`.clud/logs/pr-merge-watch/`. The first record is a UTC `START`; later
records use monotonic seconds relative to that start.

Exit codes:
  0  all required checks green AND mergeable=MERGEABLE (after the opt-in
     CodeRabbit wait below, when `--coderabbit-wait` is set)
  1  at least one required check failed (details on stdout)
  2  new review activity (unresolved coderabbit/human review)
  3  PR closed or merged out from under us
  4  timeout (configurable via --timeout, default 60min)
  5  approval required: a workflow run or check is `action_required` (a fork
     PR waiting for a maintainer); reported immediately, never pending
  6  never reported: a required check has no check run while every workflow
     run on the head commit has finished (path/branch filters, a
     `pull_request_target` run on the base commit, ...)
  7  stale: GitHub marked a required check `stale` (14 days incomplete); it
     never resolves on its own, a re-run is needed
  8  NO_CHECKS: no check will ever report (#1418): the base branch has no
     workflows, the head commit carries a skip marker (`[skip ci]`, ...), or
     the rollup stayed empty for the grace period (`--no-checks-grace`,
     default 60 s). The final event names the reason and `mergeStateStatus`;
     a `CLEAN` PR is mergeable as is
  9  CONFLICT: `mergeable=CONFLICTING` / `mergeStateStatus=DIRTY`, or
     `mergeable` stayed `UNKNOWN` for too many polls while checks were green
 10  GITHUB_UNREACHABLE: gh failed (auth, rate limit, network) for several
     polls in a row, a required failure could not be judged for lack of
     check-run data for several polls, or no repository could be resolved;
     the final event carries gh's stderr
 11  QUEUED: a run waited longer than `--max-queued` to start (off by default)
 64  USAGE: a bad flag or argument (argparse's own error). The caller's mistake,
     never a verdict: fix the command and run it again (#1331)
 124  the tool runner's watchdog stopped a resumable watch before the tool
      completed; re-invoke with the same args (`status: in-progress`)
 130/143  killed by SIGINT/SIGTERM: a final `EXIT` event with reason `killed`,
     and nothing is cancelled

A watch under the tool runner clamps its own timeout to at least 60 seconds
below the wrapper's command cap, so it can exit 4 and finish cancellation.
If the wrapper stops first, exit 124 means watch again; it is never green.

A watch only ever cancels runs on the head SHA it started on (#1418): when the
head moves it logs `head_moved`, keeps judging the new head, and skips any
cancellation. `--timeout` defaults to `$CLUD_PR_MERGE_WATCH_TIMEOUT` (else
3600 s); a caller whose tool call is capped must pass a lower value, or the
watch outlives it.

Supersession rule (#1330). Check runs are judged on the PR's *current* head
commit only, grouped by (workflow file, check name) -- never the display
`name:` -- and ordered by check-run id, not run id:
  - a `cancelled` check is replaced by any newer check in its group, even one
    still queued or in progress;
  - a completed result is replaced only by a newer check that actually ran
    (anything but `skipped`), so a skip never hides an older real failure;
  - a cancelled check with no replacement fails only when no other run of
    its workflow on the head commit replaces it: a newer run in any state
    (queued included), or any run that was not itself cancelled. Runs are
    ordered by `created_at`, then run number, never by run id: concurrency
    cancels whichever of two same-second runs entered its group first (#1710);
  - a failure in a cancelled run, or in a run a cancellation has reached, is
    replaced the same way: a superseded run's jobs are never the PR's result;
  - `success`, `neutral` and `skipped` pass, but green needs at least one
    required check that actually ran on the head SHA, a protected check that
    skipped reads as pending unless the run that skipped it completed with
    `success` (a CI tier that skips a protected job, as GitHub itself
    accepts), and without branch protection every head run must have
    completed (#1639);
  - a cancellation-derived failure is acted on only after re-reading the
    PR's head: if the head moved, the verdict is dropped and the watch
    continues on the new commit;
  - on a failure in workflow X only the failing run and X's runs created
    strictly before it are cancelled; newer runs, same-second runs and other
    workflows are left alone.
`merge_group` runs and check runs for any other commit are ignored; legacy
commit statuses keep GitHub's newest-per-context result.
The PR's check rollup never decides a failure on its own (#1742): it mixes
every run on the head, superseded ones included, with no run order. When a
poll has no REST check-run data, a required failure in the rollup is a
degraded poll, retried, and never a cancel; three in a row exit 10.

Without `--repo`, the watch targets the repo of `git remote get-url origin`
and passes it to every gh call (#1741): a bare gh call in a fork resolves to
the parent repository. gh's default repo is used only when origin is not a
github.com URL. The PR may be a number, a branch, a PR URL, or omitted for
the current branch; a branch is looked up on that same repo, and a URL names
its own.

CodeRabbit never stalls green. Nothing can reproduce CodeRabbit under a
local bosn -> act gate, and the fleet suppresses it by policy, so by default
GREEN is CI green plus mergeable and the watcher does not wait for CodeRabbit
at all. Green carries a note:
`coderabbit=<suppressed|absent|completed|rate_limited|skipped|pending|timeout>`.
- `suppressed`: the base branch's `.coderabbit.yaml` (or `.coderabbit.yml`)
  sets `reviews.auto_review.enabled: false`. It is read once per watch, only
  when CodeRabbit shows up at all, and no status is read after it.
- `absent`: CodeRabbit is not active here, or its `CodeRabbit` commit status
  is not on the head. That is final at once; there is no grace period.
- Otherwise the newest `CodeRabbit` status on the head SHA is reported as it
  stands (`pending` means it was not waited for).
`--coderabbit-wait N` opts in to waiting, for repos that still run CodeRabbit
(#1332): once required CI is green, a `pending` status is waited for at most N
seconds (never past `--timeout`), then green reads `coderabbit=timeout`. The
wait never fails and never cancels. `Review rate limited` and `Review skipped`
count as finished. New CodeRabbit threads still exit 2. The `CodeRabbit`
status itself is not a CI check unless branch protection requires it.

The exit code IS the result — do not pipe this through `tail`, `grep` or
`head`. A pipeline reports the *last* stage's status, so every one of the
codes above collapses to whatever the filter exited with, and `tail` buffers
to EOF so the per-poll progress lines vanish too. Redirect to a file and read
it, or run it bare.

# --- Session read-broker subscription (#1743 phase 3) ----------------------
#
# Inside a clud session whose gh reads go through the daemon's read broker,
# the watch blocks on `POST /gh/watch` between polls instead of sleeping: the
# broker re-reads the PR's REST state at its own cadence (its TTL, shared by
# every reader, free `304`s while nothing changed) and returns the moment a
# body changes. The poll that follows judges exactly as before. Outside a
# session, or when the daemon does not answer, the watch polls as it always
# did.

# Mirrors `gh_broker::FORWARDED_ENV` (crates/clud-bin/src/gh_broker/mod.rs):
# the identity, and so the cache keys, of this process's brokered reads.
# tests/test_pr_merge_watch_subscription.py fails if the two drift.
