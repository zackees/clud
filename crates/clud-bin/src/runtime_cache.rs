//! Canonical per-version runtime cache for `clud.exe` (issue #333).
//!
//! Feature-flagged cache hop for #333. This module owns the cache-path
//! computation, the cross-platform "am I running from the cache?"
//! predicate, the double-checked file-locked [`prepare_cached_clud_in`]
//! copy-once helper, and the opt-in re-exec hop. The hop is gated
//! behind `CLUD_USE_RUNTIME_CACHE=1` so production behavior stays
//! unchanged until the default-on phase.
//!
//! Design summary (full version in issue #333):
//! - Layout: `~/.clud/runtime/clud-<version>/<binary-name>`.
//! - On first invocation per version, copy `current_exe()` into the
//!   cache dir under a file lock; subsequent invocations re-exec
//!   from the cache hit and skip the trampoline entirely.
//! - Direct port of zccache's `runtime-binaries/` pattern
//!   (`runtime_binaries_dir` / `prepare_daemon_exe` /
//!   `exe_is_under_runtime_binaries` in zccache's
//!   `crates/zccache/src/{cli/runtime.rs, daemon/trampoline.rs}`),
//!   with the cache key changed from per-launch random to per-version
//!   so subsequent invocations are zero-I/O cache hits.
