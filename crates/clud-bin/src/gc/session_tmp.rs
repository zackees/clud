//! Session temp directory (`~/.clud/tmp`) — issue #509.
//!
//! While a clud session is active we point the backend agent's temp dir
//! (`TMPDIR` on Unix, `TMP`+`TEMP` on Windows) at a clud-owned location so
//! the scatter of agent/tooling temp files lands somewhere the daemon can
//! reclaim, instead of the OS temp dir where nothing ages it out.
//!
//! Two halves:
//! - [`ensure_dir`] — resolve `~/.clud/tmp`, create it, hand the path back
//!   to the env builders in `runner.rs` / `daemon/io_helpers.rs`.
//! - [`sweep_stale_at`] — drop entries that are both older than
//!   [`STALE_THRESHOLD`] (72h) by their own mtime *and* have no recent
//!   activity anywhere beneath them, to a bounded depth
//!   ([`MAX_NESTED_DEPTH`]). Driven from the daemon's periodic tick via
//!   `daemon/session_tmp_sweep.rs`.
//!
//!   This said "drop **top-level** entries" until #1148, and meant it: a
//!   directory's mtime tracks its *direct* children only, so the agent
//!   harness's `claude-<uid>/<project>/<session>/` tree — whose root gains a
//!   child whenever a new project is used, and is therefore permanently
//!   fresh — was skipped in full, forever. 59 GB of it, on the box that
//!   reported this, while the sweep deleted 2,731 flat entries a day and
//!   logged every one. The failure mode to keep in mind here is not "the
//!   sweep stopped running"; it is "the sweep ran happily and could not see.
//!
//! Like `gc::uv_cache`, this operates directly on the filesystem — there is
//! no redb registry row. All errors are non-fatal: a failed sweep never
//! crashes the daemon, and a failed `ensure_dir` just falls back to the OS
//! temp dir (the env vars are simply not overridden).
