# src/

Entry point and source tree for the `clud-bin` Rust binary. The binary launches
a backend agent (`claude` or `codex`) in YOLO mode, optionally through a PTY,
with first-class support for loop iterations, drag-and-drop, voice input, and a
per-user daemon for backgrounded/detachable sessions. `main.rs` does
cross-cutting startup work (trampoline unlock, console title, launch setup
selection, session-cap registration, GC scanner) and then hands off to
`runner.rs`, which drives the per-iteration subprocess/PTY launch loop for a
single [`LaunchPlan`]. Submodules under `command/`, `daemon/`, `dnd/`, and
`voice/` carry the bulk of the domain logic; the top-level `.rs` files here are
the orchestration glue and standalone utilities consumed by both `main.rs` and
the integration tests.

## Subdirectories

- [command/](command/README.md) - `LaunchPlan` construction: backend argv
  assembly, YOLO/safe injection, `loop`/`up`/`rebase`/`fix` prompt synthesis,
  `--repeat` schedule parsing, DONE/BLOCKED contract.
- [daemon/](daemon/README.md) - long-lived session manager for `--detach` /
  `attach` / `list` / `kill` / `logs` / `--repeat`: TCP JSON IPC, per-session
  worker subprocesses, snapshot + log persistence, attach broker.
- [dnd/](dnd/README.md) - drag-and-drop into the terminal: cross-platform
  path-string normalizer plus Windows-only `IDropTarget` adapter with
  per-launch-mode injectors.
- [voice/](voice/README.md) - F3 push-to-talk voice mode: mic capture,
  start/stop cues, `whisper-rs` worker thread, transcript injection into the
  backend PTY.
- [memory/](memory/README.md) - agent-memory storage foundation: `SqliteStore`
  (rusqlite + sqlite-vec) for content + KNN, `LexicalIndex` (tantivy BM25),
  RRF fusion. Pure storage; tier lifecycle, embedder, MCP, daemon-IPC, and
  CLI verbs live in sibling sub-issues under META #255.

## Top-Level Modules

Entry and orchestration:

- `main.rs` - process entry: launch clock, trampoline unlock, console title
  stamp + keeper, launch setup selection, large-file guard, session-cap
  registration, GC scanner, dispatch to runner / daemon / hook-health / GC
  subcommands.
- `lib.rs` - library facade so integration tests under `tests/` can link
  against internals; `main.rs` imports through this rather than re-declaring
  `mod ...`.
- `runner.rs` - per-iteration subprocess- and PTY-mode runner for a single
  `LaunchPlan`; owns child-env construction, stream-json fallback,
  Ctrl-C-aware teardown, and OLE drag-drop registration wiring.
- `startup.rs` - launch-time helpers factored out of `main.rs`: drag-target
  gating (`--no-dnd`, `--dry-run`), session-cap enforcement, Ctrl+C flag
  installer.

CLI surface and backend resolution:

- `args.rs` - `clap` `Args` and `Command` definitions; passthrough for unknown
  flags; subcommand definitions for `loop`, `up`, `rebase`, `fix`, `gc`, etc.
- `backend.rs` - `Backend` enum (`Claude` / `Codex`), `LaunchMode`
  (`Subprocess` / `Pty`), PATH lookup, and backend-path resolution.
- `subprocess.rs` - single decision point for the Windows `.cmd`/`.bat`
  rewrite (BatBadBat / CVE-2024-24576) via `running-process-core`'s
  `CommandSpec::Shell`.

Console and terminal:

- `console_input.rs` - Windows `ReadConsoleInputW` translator (issue #141):
  pure-function map from `KEY_EVENT_RECORD` slices to PTY stdin bytes.
- `console_setup.rs` - RAII guard that enables
  `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_INPUT` for the lifetime of a PTY session and
  restores the prior console mode on drop; no-op on POSIX.
- `console_title.rs` - stamps `clud <cwd-name>` once on launch and runs a
  background keeper that re-applies the title when downstream OSC 0/2 sequences
  overwrite it.
- `capture.rs` - server-side terminal emulator (`vt100` + `vte` sticky-mode
  sniffer) that lets the daemon synthesize a repaint when a mid-session client
  attaches.
- `session.rs` - raw-PTY pump (`run_raw_pty_pump`), resize handling, F3 voice
  observer hook, OSC-title stripper integration, dropped-path injection on the
  PTY master.

Loop subsystem (`clud loop`):

- `loop_spec.rs` - task-spec resolver: classifies the positional (GH URL,
  `#42`, file, literal), fetches GH issue/PR bodies via `gh` (curl fallback),
  caches under `.clud/loop/`, locates DONE/BLOCKED marker files.
- `loop_check.rs` - post-iteration DONE/BLOCKED marker check; file-only and
  stdout-scanning variants used by PTY and subprocess paths respectively.
- `loop_artifacts.rs` - durable `<git-root>/.clud/loop/` artifacts:
  `info.json` (`TaskInfo`), `log.txt`, `motivation.md`, and `.gitignore`
  auto-injection.
- `stream_json.rs` - pure renderer for claude's `--output-format stream-json`
  events; turns one JSON event per line into one human-readable progress line
  for subprocess-mode loops.

Process management and GC:

- `process_tree.rs` - best-effort descendant-tree termination via `sysinfo`;
  fixes the multi-second Ctrl+C hang for `clud --codex` on Windows where
  `cmd.exe -> node.exe` would orphan the real child.
- `session_registry.rs` - `redb`-backed registry of live `clud` PIDs that caps
  concurrent siblings; `Drop` removes the row, startup GCs dead rows.
- `gc.rs` - `clud gc list` / `purge` / `reconcile` CLI handlers and the
  in-process `WorktreeScanner` thread. The GC registry itself lives inside the
  daemon.
- `worktrees.rs` - `--clean-worktrees` (issue #83): enumerates via
  `git worktree list --porcelain`, classifies clean / dirty / unpushed / gone,
  removes safe ones; `--dry-run` faithful.

Platform glue:

- `trampoline.rs` - Windows-only rename-self-and-copy-back trick so
  `pip install` can always overwrite `Scripts/clud.exe`. No-op on POSIX.
- `win_creation_flags.rs` - `invisible_helper_creationflags()` returns
  `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on Windows for daemon-helper spawns; `0` elsewhere so call
  sites stay portable.
- `large_file_guard.rs` - startup-time `ignore`-crate walker that warns about
  source files large enough to choke agents (issue #132); hard 1 s deadline.
- `launch_setup.rs` - session-only/global setup selector plus
  selected-backend persistent setup actions for skills and Codex hook
  normalization.

Skills and hooks:

- `skills.rs` - bundles slash-command skills via `include_str!` and installs
  them during global launch setup for the selected backend (`.claude/skills/`,
  Codex `.agents/skills/` gated on `.codex`) only when the backend home already
  exists; never overwrites existing files; purges stale clud-managed Codex
  copies from `.codex/skills/`.
- `skill_install.rs` - Claude global-setup installer for the `clud-*` skill
  set; compares embedded vs installed `SKILL.md` modulo whitespace and
  overwrites divergent copies; purges retired managed skills from
  `PURGED_SKILLS`.
- `hook_health.rs` - `PreToolUse` hook parity diagnostics and `--fix-hooks`
  remediation.
- `codex_hook_normalize.rs` - issue #234: idempotent Codex global-setup pass
  that bumps any `~/.codex/hooks.json` handler `timeout: 5` to `30`
  (`~/.clud/settings.lock` fs4 guard, green status line on change).

Diagnostics and misc:

- `verbose_log.rs` - launch-clock + opt-in file logging
  (`CLUD_VERBOSE_LOG_DIR`); `log()` writes timestamped lines to the per-launch
  log file.
- `wasm.rs` - `wasmi`-based runner that loads a WASM module, registers a
  minimal `host.log` import, invokes a named export, and propagates the integer
  exit code.

Quick lookup, which file owns a given subcommand:

- `clud loop ...` -> `command::build_launch_plan` (prompt + markers) +
  `loop_spec` (task resolution) + `loop_artifacts` (artifact files) +
  `runner.rs` (iteration loop) + `loop_check` (DONE/BLOCKED scan).
- `clud --detach`, `clud attach`, `clud list`, `clud kill`, `clud logs` -> all
  in `daemon/` (dispatched from `daemon::handle_special_command`).
- `clud gc list` / `purge` / `reconcile` -> `gc.rs` (CLI handlers) talking to
  `daemon/gc_service.rs` (registry owner inside the always-on `__daemon`).
- `clud --clean-worktrees` -> `worktrees.rs`.
- `clud --fix-hooks` -> `hook_health.rs`.
- `clud mcp` -> `mcp_bridge.rs` (stdio↔TCP proxy) -> `daemon/memory_mcp.rs`
  (in-process MCP server, issue #259).

## Cross-Cutting Subsystems

Subsystems that span multiple files have their own topic docs under
`docs/architecture/`:

- **Loop subsystem** (`command/`, `loop_spec`, `loop_check`, `loop_artifacts`,
  `stream_json`, `runner`) -> [docs/architecture/loop-subsystem.md](../../../docs/architecture/loop-subsystem.md)
- **Daemon IPC** (everything under `daemon/`) -> [docs/architecture/daemon-ipc.md](../../../docs/architecture/daemon-ipc.md)
- **Session lifecycle** (`session`, `console_*`, `capture`, `dnd` injection,
  `voice` hooks) -> [docs/architecture/session-lifecycle.md](../../../docs/architecture/session-lifecycle.md)
- **Skill system** (`skills`, `skill_install`, `assets/skills/`) -> [docs/architecture/skill-system.md](../../../docs/architecture/skill-system.md)
- **Launch setup** (`launch_setup`, selected-backend persistent setup) -> [docs/architecture/launch-setup.md](../../../docs/architecture/launch-setup.md)
- **GC and registry** (`gc`, `daemon/gc_service`, `session_registry`,
  `worktrees`) -> [docs/architecture/gc-and-registry.md](../../../docs/architecture/gc-and-registry.md)
- **Windows quirks** (`trampoline`, `subprocess` BatBadBat, `console_*`,
  `dnd`, `win_creation_flags`, `voice` ARM carveout) -> [docs/architecture/windows-quirks.md](../../../docs/architecture/windows-quirks.md)
- **Launch plan** (`command/types::LaunchPlan` + all consumers) -> [docs/architecture/launch-plan.md](../../../docs/architecture/launch-plan.md)

Non-obvious design choices (single `LaunchPlan`, `lib.rs` as the only
`mod ...` site, cooperative Ctrl+C, redb single-owner) have ADRs in
[docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md](../../../docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md).

## Entry Point

`main.rs` is the binary entry; `lib.rs` re-exports every top-level module (and
the four subdirs) as `pub mod ...` so integration tests under
`crates/clud-bin/tests/` can link against internals. See
[DD-007](../../../docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#dd-007-librs-is-the-only-place-that-declares-modules-mainrs-imports-through-clud)
for why the single-instantiation pattern matters.
