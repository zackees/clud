//! The corrupt-index escape hatch, end to end (#556).
//!
//! `index_pass` distinguishes "no index" from "index that will not parse", and
//! #556 requires those to route differently: no index means walk the tree,
//! but a *corrupt* index must take one killable `git ls-files --debug` first.
//! Falling straight to the walker there would surrender the entire win on
//! precisely the repos most likely to be large.
//!
//! These live in their own file rather than in `index_pass`'s test module
//! because they exercise the *routing* across both passes, not either one.
