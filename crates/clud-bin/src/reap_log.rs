//! Reaper accounting and its per-session log (#673 Phases 0 and 5).
//!
//! Reaping is destructive and, until now, silent: the only trace a session
//! left was a structured event per decision in the shared daemon event log,
//! interleaved with everything else the daemon writes. That is why #651 could
//! be closed as fixed while the same symptom kept growing — nobody could see
//! the backlog.
//!
//! Two surfaces, both cheap:
//!
//! - **[`ReapCounters`]** — the Phase 0 measurement series. `known.len()`,
//!   backlog size, environment reads, reconcile ticks, and the decision
//!   census. Reported under `--verbose` and in the exit summary.
//! - **[`ReapLog`]** — one JSONL line per *mutation*, alongside the session's
//!   other artifacts. Never a line for a no-op pass.
//!
//! ## Why the writer is buffered
//!
//! #544 found per-operation synchronous JSONL flushes to be an idle-CPU cost
//! in their own right. A reap log that fsynced per decision would trade one
//! idle-CPU finding for another, so this one accumulates and flushes on a size
//! or time threshold, and once at exit.
//!
//! ## The two reconciliation identities
//!
//! ```text
//! shell_exits_observed == finalized + abandoned + still_pending_at_exit
//! decisions_emitted    == reaped + spared
//! ```
//!
//! They are deliberately separate, and `tracked` belongs to neither, because
//! the populations are disjoint: most spawned processes are never reap
//! candidates (only shell images become triggers); abandoned identities are
//! *triggers* while kill targets are their *descendants*; a reap decision can
//! be downgraded to a spare at execution time; and a kill takes a whole
//! subtree without emitting a decision per descendant. An identity that
//! equated them would be arithmetic that cannot hold.
