//! End-to-end request pipeline for the Codex bridge (issue #627 phase 3,
//! step 5).
//!
//! Chains the four pieces built in steps 1-4 into one call:
//!
//! ```text
//! Anthropic request -> codex_translate -> codex_upstream -> codex_sse -> Anthropic SSE
//! ```
//!
//! Upstream is *always* streamed, even for a non-streaming Messages request.
//! Aggregating the translated Anthropic events into a final `Message` reuses
