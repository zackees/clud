//! `clud symbols` — inspect or verify crash-report symbolication.
//!
//! Background: clud builds with `debug = "line-tables-only"` keep the
//! line tables in the binary itself (#374 PR 1, see
//! [`crate::crash_report`]), so a backtrace resolves to file:line with
//! nothing to fetch. Local dev builds stop there — everything is
//! embedded. Release builds no longer do: `[profile.release]` sets
//! `split-debuginfo = "packed"`, which moves the rest of the DWARF into
//! a sidecar (a `.dwp` on Linux, the `.pdb` / `.dSYM` Windows and macOS
//! always produced) so the manylinux wheel fits under PyPI's 100 MB
//! project limit. What a release binary loses without its `.dwp` is the
//! inlined-subroutine DIEs: file:line still resolves per *physical*
//! frame and function names still come from `.symtab`, but the expanded
//! inline caller chain does not. CI attaches the `.dwp` to the GitHub
//! release, so the "fetch sidecars on first unsymbolicated report" path
//! from the original issue is real work again rather than a no-op.
//!
//! - `clud symbols` (bare) prints a five-line summary of the crash-
//!   reports directory.
//! - `clud symbols install` fetches the sidecar the most recent report
//!   needs, but only after the release's `BUILD-IDS.txt` says the report's
//!   GNU build-id is the published binary for its triple. It checks the
//!   sidecar against the release's `SHA256SUMS` and caches it under
//!   `~/.clud/state/symbols/<build-id>/`. A report from a local build or a
//!   same-version rebuild has no matching entry, so nothing is fetched and
//!   the user is pointed at the `target/` tree beside the binary instead.
//! - `clud symbols verify [--all]` checks that the running binary can
//!   resolve a report's backtrace. Exits 1 if it can't. `--all` widens
//!   the scope from the most recent report to every report.
//!
//! # Network
//!
//! `install` is the only thing here that reaches the network, and only
//! when a person types it. The crash path does not fetch — the process is
//! already dying and may be in a signal handler where allocation is
//! unsafe — the startup notice does not fetch, and `verify` does not
//! fetch. Air-gapped hosts therefore keep working, with local
//! unsymbolicated output as the fallback (#1016).
//!
//! The opportunistic startup notice (see [`crate::crash_report::install`])
//! prints a one-line hint pointing at `clud symbols verify` when a fresh
//! report's backtrace is unsymbolicated, so users discover the command
//! without needing to remember it.
