//! One host environment pass, owned by clud (#673 Phase 7).
//!
//! Every reaper in clud needs two answers about the same set of processes:
//!
//! 1. *which processes carry `RUNNING_PROCESS_ORIGINATOR=CLUD:<pid>`* — the
//!    additive kill-target set, and
//! 2. *which processes carry `RUNNING_PROCESS_IS_DAEMON`* — the subtractive
//!    spare-list.
//!
//! Both live in the process environment block, which on Windows means a
//! `ReadProcessMemory` walk of every PEB on the host. `running_process`
//! answers them through two separate entry points
//! ([`running_process::originator::find_processes_by_originator`] and
//! `find_declared_daemon_pids`), each of which builds its own
//! [`sysinfo::System`] and does its own full-host pass — so a single orphan
//! sweep paid for the most expensive enumeration on the machine **twice**,
//! back to back, for two questions about the same processes.
//!
//! ## Why this is reimplemented here rather than fixed upstream
//!
//! `running_process` 4.6.4 depends on `sysinfo 0.30.13`; clud depends directly
//! on `sysinfo 0.37.2`. Those are distinct nominal types, so no snapshot can
//! cross the boundary: clud cannot hand the crate a `System` it already
//! refreshed, and the crate's `System::new()`-per-call shape structurally
//! forbids incremental caching. Reimplementing the two queries against 0.37
//! inside clud is self-contained, needs no upstream release, and is what makes
//! [`DaemonMarkerCache`] possible.
//!
//! The 0.30 `is_parent_alive` start-time comparison is replicated exactly (see
//! [`parent_is_plausible`]); the behaviour of the two queries is otherwise
//! unchanged, with one addition: [`TaggedProcess`] carries `start_time`, so a
//! caller can pin `(pid, creation_time)` at selection time and re-verify it
//! before killing (#673 Phase 6).
//!
//! ## The cache
//!
//! [`DaemonMarkerCache`] answers "did this PID declare itself a daemon?" for a
//! *bounded candidate set* rather than for the host, and reads the environment
//! only for identities it has not seen before. It is safe to keep stale
//! because the daemon marker is **subtractive** — a stale entry can only spare
//! too much, never kill something it should not have.
