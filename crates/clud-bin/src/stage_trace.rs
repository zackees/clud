//! Stage breadcrumbs for a launch that never exits (#594, #1168).
//!
//! `run_clud` in the integration harness points `CLUD_EXIT_TIMING_FILE` at a
//! scratch file on every launch and, when it has to kill a process that blew
//! its budget, renders that file: a stage that was entered and never
//! completed is where the process was stuck. The exit stages in `main.rs`
//! have used this since #594. #1168 showed the file empty on a wedged
//! `clud -p` run whose backend had already finished, so the launch phase --
//! spawn, wait, child teardown, the drops between the runner returning and
//! the exit stages starting -- now leaves the same breadcrumbs.
//!
//! Each line is `<kind>-stage begin <name>` followed by
//! `<kind>-stage done <name>=<ms>ms`; the harness only cares that a `begin`
//! has a matching `done`. Writes are best-effort and append-only so a process
//! killed mid-write still leaves every earlier line readable.
//!
//! Two sinks, deliberately. stderr stays behind `enabled` (`--verbose` or
//! `CLUD_EXIT_TIMING`), because an unconditional line there would break every
//! test asserting clean stderr. The file sink never touches stderr, so the
//! harness can enable attribution on every launch without perturbing an
//! assertion, and still recover the trace from a process it had to kill.
