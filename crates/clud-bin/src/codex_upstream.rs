//! Upstream Responses client for the Codex bridge (issue #627 phase 3, step 4).
//!
//! Two responsibilities, kept apart on purpose:
//!
//! - [`CredentialSource`] yields the base URL, auth material, account headers,
//!   and model policy. Putting this behind a trait is what lets #629's
//!   subscription auth reuse every line of translation without touching it.
//! - [`UpstreamClient`] performs one streaming `POST /v1/responses`, handing
//!   each byte chunk to a sink as it arrives.
//!
//! ## The retry boundary
//!
//! The issue's rule is "never replay a request after downstream-visible output
//! has begun", and step 1 is why it is absolute: once `write_event_stream` has
//! flushed a single frame, the 200 and its headers are already on the wire, so
//! there is no status code left to change and a replay would duplicate content
//! the user has already seen. The client therefore tracks whether the sink has
//! accepted anything, and refuses to retry once it has — regardless of how
//! retryable the failure looks.
//!
//! ## Secrets
//!
//! No client header is forwarded upstream. The allowlist is empty by
//! construction: this module builds every outbound header itself, so the
//! harness's own Anthropic bearer cannot leak into an upstream request. In the
//! other direction, transport failures are classified into fixed strings
//! rather than carrying the library's message, because those messages embed
//! the URL and would put the endpoint into logs.
