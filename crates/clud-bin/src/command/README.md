# command/

Builds the `LaunchPlan` that downstream runners execute: effective-harness-specific argv assembly (`claude` vs `codex`), YOLO/safe-mode injection, subcommand-driven prompt construction (`loop`, `up`, `rebase`, `fix`, `do`, `grind`), `--repeat` schedule parsing, DONE/BLOCKED marker contract wiring for `clud loop`, and Claude `stream-json` progress injection for subprocess-mode loops.

The `LaunchPlan` contract (construction pipeline, consumers, `--dry-run` JSON) is documented at [docs/architecture/launch-plan.md](../../../../docs/architecture/launch-plan.md); the DONE/BLOCKED contract and `--repeat` no-overlap scheduler at [docs/architecture/loop-subsystem.md](../../../../docs/architecture/loop-subsystem.md).
`grind` is distinct: its intended contract is one normal interactive PTY prompt
seeded with `/loop`, after which the harness owns repetition. It must not use
the clud loop marker contract, a headless launch, an iteration ceiling, or
external relaunching. It requires the Claude harness. See
[grind.md](../../../../docs/architecture/grind.md).
Provider/harness resolution happens before construction and is documented at
[docs/architecture/launch-targets.md](../../../../docs/architecture/launch-targets.md).
Provider-neutral model/effort/context normalization and direct-vs-unified
routing are documented at
[docs/architecture/provider-selection.md](../../../../docs/architecture/provider-selection.md).

## Files

- `mod.rs` — module facade; re-exports the resolved-target production builder, the native compatibility builder, supporting helpers, and the `LaunchPlan` / `LoopMarkers` / `RepeatSchedule` types.
- `builder.rs` — core `build_launch_plan_for_target` orchestrator, the native `build_launch_plan` compatibility wrapper, typed daemon-headless turn plans, backend-aware interactive/headless prompt classification, and repeat/task helpers. It also builds the Claude-harness `/loop` seed for `grind`; the required one-PTY handoff is specified in [grind.md](../../../../docs/architecture/grind.md). Headless turns retain shared model/safety policy while producing Claude stream-json session argv or Codex `exec [resume] --json` argv. Also owns the `--disallowedTools` policy: `bridge_suppresses_plan_mode` strips `EnterPlanMode` on every Codex-provider / Claude-harness launch (the model can otherwise enter plan mode unprompted — see [DD-033](../../../../docs/DESIGN_DECISIONS.md#dd-033-plan-mode-is-disabled-unconditionally-on-the-codex-to-claude-bridge)), `--unattended` / `clud loop` additionally strip `AskUserQuestion`, and `plan_mode_suppression_notice` emits the green TTY-only override hint.
- `do_input.rs` — resolves `clud do`'s optional URL/free-form target before backend setup or spawn; prompts only on a foreground TTY and returns deterministic errors for dry-run, pipe, and background modes.
- `loop_task.rs` — resolves the `clud loop` positional (GH issue/PR URL, `#42` shortform, file path, or literal) into prompt text, with `gh`-backed cache under `.clud/loop/`.
- `prompts.rs` — static prompt templates (`FIX_PROMPT`, `GITHUB_FIX_TEMPLATE`, `DO_GOAL_TEMPLATE`, `REBASE_PROMPT`, `UP_PROMPT`) and the backend-aware `push_prompt`, `build_up_prompt`, `build_fix_prompt`, `build_do_prompt` builders.
- `types.rs` — `LaunchPlan`, `LoopMarkers`, `RepeatSchedule` serde structs that flow into `--dry-run` JSON and into daemon job records; the plan carries additive `routing_mode` and normalized `model_selection` fields.
- `tests.rs` — 60+ unit tests covering yolo/safe, codex `exec`/`resume`, loop contract injection, stream-json placement before `-p`, `--repeat` parsing edge cases, and scheduler no-overlap invariants.

## Used by

- `main.rs` — calls `build_launch_plan_for_target` and `repeat_implies_no_done_warning` to assemble the resolved plan and emit the `--repeat` warning before dispatch.
- `runner.rs` — consumes `LaunchPlan` to spawn PTY/subprocess and drive iteration loops.
- `loop_check.rs` — reads `plan.loop_markers` to poll DONE/BLOCKED after each iteration.
- `hook_health/prompts.rs` — builds a plan as part of doctor-style health probes.
- `daemon/entry.rs`, `daemon/types.rs` — persist and re-execute `LaunchPlan` records via the daemon worker.
- `loop_artifacts.rs` — references the `chrono_like_now` algorithm pattern from `loop_task.rs`.
