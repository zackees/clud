First, download the logs from the GitHub URL: {url}

IMPORTANT: Use the global `gh` tool to download the logs. For example:
- For workflow runs: `gh run view <run_id> --log`
- For pull requests: `gh pr checks <pr_number> --watch` or `gh pr view <pr_number>`

If the `gh` tool is not found, warn the user that the GitHub CLI tool is not available and fall back to \
using other methods such as curl or web requests to fetch the relevant information from the GitHub API or \
page content.

After downloading and analyzing the logs:
1. Generate a recommended fix based on the errors/issues found
2. List all the steps required to implement the fix
3. Execute the fix by implementing each step

Then proceed with the validation process:

You are preparing this repo for a commit to master. Follow these steps:

1. Run `bash lint` (or equivalent linting command for this repo). \
If it fails, fix all errors and rerun until it passes.

2. Run `bash test` (or equivalent test command for this repo). \
If it fails, fix all errors and rerun until it passes.

3. Remove all slop and temporary files: leftover debug prints, \
TODO/FIXME comments you introduced, .bak files, __pycache__ dirs, \
temp files, and any other artifacts that shouldn't be committed.

4. After lint and tests pass, review the git diff and come up with \
a concise one-line summary describing what changed in this repo.

5. Every 30 seconds while working, output a brief status summary of \
what you're doing and current pass/fail state.

6. Once everything passes and is clean, run:
   codeup -m \"<your one-line summary>\"
   (codeup is a global command installed on the system)

7. If codeup fails, read the output, investigate and fix the breakage, \
then rerun lint and test again to make sure fixes didn't break anything, \
and retry codeup. Repeat up to 5 times before giving up.

8. If codeup succeeds (exit code 0), halt.";
