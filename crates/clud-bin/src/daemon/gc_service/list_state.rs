//! Issue #896: give every `clud gc list` row a *state* and a *reason*.
//!
//! The extern-repo git-dirty guard made GC refuse to reclaim a checkout
//! holding local work. That is correct, but it means such a row sits in the
//! registry forever looking exactly like garbage GC keeps failing to
//! collect. Surfacing why a row is retained is what makes the retained set
//! legible.
//!
//! **`gc list` must never run the extern-repo git probe.** It is a hot
//! client op — the launch path calls into the same registry worker — and
//! that probe costs up to three subprocesses per checkout. So the verdict
//! is *not* recomputed here. Since #946 the probe runs on its own thread
//! (`spawn_extern_probe`) and publishes a complete snapshot back to the
//! worker as `RegistryMsg::ExternVerdicts`; this module holds that snapshot.
//!
//! That does not make `List` subprocess-free, and it would be dishonest to
//! imply so: it still calls `collect_live_lock_paths`, which shells out to
//! `git worktree list --porcelain` via the *unbounded* `worktrees::run_git`.
//! That is a separate, pre-existing path from the probe #946 moved.
