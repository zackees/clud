//! Publish the daemon's CPU-alert state to a file instead of answering M polls
//! for it (#547, sub-issue of the #542 idle-CPU meta).
//!
//! # What this replaces
//!
//! Every Windows `clud` client used to issue a `DaemonRequest::Metrics`
//! loopback round-trip every 2 seconds, forever, so it could flash the console
//! title when the daemon exceeds 70% CPU. With M open terminals that is M
//! connections every 2 s and M single-PID sysinfo refreshes daemon-side — and
//! in the idle steady state **100% of that traffic produces "no alert"**.
//!
//! # The inversion
//!
//! The daemon samples its own CPU on one timer and writes
//! [`METRICS_SNAPSHOT`] **only when the alert-relevant state changes**. Clients
//! `stat` that file's mtime once per keeper pass — no socket, no daemon work —
//! and parse it only when the mtime moved.
//!
//! Idle steady state: zero daemon writes, zero client connections, one `stat`
//! per client per tick.
//!
//! # Why a file rather than a pushed connection
//!
//! clud's IPC is request/response. Holding a persistent per-client connection
//! open for push would keep M sockets alive and complicate daemon shutdown. An
//! mtime `stat` is the cheapest cross-process signal available, and it degrades
//! the way the old code already did: the file being absent or unreadable clears
//! the alert, exactly like the previous `Err(_) => clear_cpu_alert()`.
