//! OS-authoritative daemon-sparing signals, shared by **both** reapers (#688).
//!
//! #673 Phase 1a introduced the signal table so that a build cache, a language
//! server or a container daemon started inside a clud session survives that
//! session — none of them set the cooperative `RUNNING_PROCESS_IS_DAEMON`
//! marker, so a marker-only spare-list gives them nothing.
//!
//! That machinery originally lived inside [`crate::job_orphan_reaper`], which
//! is Windows-only and whose blast radius is one tool shell. The *cross*-platform
//! reaper — [`crate::orphan_reaper`], which runs on every foreground `clud`
//! exit, on `clud slay`, and on the daemon's periodic sweep — still spared by
//! the marker alone, so an sccache-shaped daemon survived the shell that
//! started it and was then killed moments later by clud's own exit. This module
//! is that machinery lifted out so one table serves both.
//!
//! ## What lives here and what does not
//!
//! Everything here is a *pure function of injected data* ([`FactsSnapshot`]),
//! plus one clearly-fenced per-platform producer ([`collect_host_facts`]). No
//! code that decides *reap or spare* may call the OS directly; that is what
//! makes the decision table unit-testable on every platform without spawning
//! anything (#674).
//!
//! [`crate::job_orphan_reaper`] re-exports these under its own
//! `ReapDecisionReason`, which additionally carries the tool-shell-specific
//! reasons (leaked tool client, git-bash re-exec, …) that have no meaning here.
