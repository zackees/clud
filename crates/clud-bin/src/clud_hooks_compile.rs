//! Compiling clud's hook set into a frontend's native configuration
//! (zackees/clud#977, #967 Phase 2b).
//!
//! clud does not write hook lines into anyone's settings file. It composes the
//! registration a frontend needs and hands it over as a **launch argument**,
//! which removes a whole class of hazards a file-writing design carries:
//! idempotence, read-modify-write lost updates, two writers fighting over one
//! file (#847), per-repo gitignore assumptions, and stale state left behind by
//! a killed session. See DD-049.
//!
//! ## What gets registered
//!
//! One dispatcher line per declared event, matching every tool:
//!
//! ```json
//! { "hooks": { "Stop": [ { "matcher": "*",
//!     "hooks": [ { "type": "command", "command": "clud-cmd-scan --event Stop" } ] } ] } }
//! ```
//!
//! Matching every tool is deliberate. The per-hook `matcher` a repo declares is
//! applied by clud when it dispatches, so narrowing here would silently drop
//! declarations: an installed line scoped to `Bash` can never deliver an
//! `Edit`-matched hook.
//!
//! ## Frontend support is not uniform
//!
//! **Claude** takes `--settings <file-or-json>`, an *additional* source that
//! merges with the settings files rather than replacing them, with hook entries
//! concatenating across levels. That is the whole mechanism.
//!
//! **Codex has no argument surface for hooks at all.** Its `-c key=value`
//! overrides values that would otherwise come from `config.toml`, and codex
//! hooks live in a separate `hooks.json`; no flag points at an alternate one.
//! So codex keeps the coverage the already-installed `clud-cmd-scan` PreToolUse
//! line gives it — which since #980 runs declared hooks too — and gets nothing
//! for other events, matching codex's own apparent single-event support. No
//! second codex writer is introduced.
//!
//! ## The `CwdChanged` backstop (#967 Phase 5)
//!
//! Alongside the declared events, clud registers one line of its own:
//! `clud-cmd-scan --event CwdChanged`, the reactive drift backstop that
//! catches a session cwd moved by an alias or a script, which the PreToolUse
//! scanner cannot see. It is registered only where the frontend supports the
//! event — the capability probe answers for the installed client, and a
//! negative answer (or a probe that cannot run) degrades silently to no line
//! at all, because the backstop is hygiene, never correctness (DD-064).
