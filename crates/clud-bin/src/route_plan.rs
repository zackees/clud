//! One resolved route per launch (#1852 step 1, issue #1855).
//!
//! clud reaches non-Anthropic models through four backends, each of which used
//! to re-derive the same launch decisions from `LaunchPlan` and the provider
//! descriptor: the direct overlay, the unified gateway, the Codex-via-Claude
//! bridge, and the DeepSeek-native harness. This module makes that decision
//! **once**, as a pure function of the plan (plus the one piece of process
//! state the precedence rule genuinely needs, [`Ambient`]).
//!
//! Step 1 only *computes* the route and carries it on `LaunchPlan`; no backend
//! reads it yet. Steps 2-4 turn each backend into a renderer of this value and
//! then delete the copies it replaces, so the snapshots in
//! `route_snapshots_tests.rs` must stay byte-identical through those steps.
//!
//! Two deliberate deviations from the sketch in #1852:
//!
//! - `scrub`, `base_url` and the credential identifiers are owned `String`s
//!   rather than `&'static`, because the route rides on `LaunchPlan` and must
//!   survive a lossless serde round trip to a daemon worker.
//! - `CredentialSource::Vault(ModelProvider)` names the provider rather than a
//!   `{service, account}` pair. The identifiers are read from the provider's
//!   registry descriptor at spawn time, which is what removes the hard-coded
//!   vault constants the unified overlay carries today (divergence #5).
//!
//! A fifth [`RouteBackend::Native`] covers a plain Claude launch, which has no
//! provider overlay at all and therefore re-derives nothing.
