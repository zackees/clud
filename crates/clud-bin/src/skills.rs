//! Bundle slash-command "skills" inside the `clud` binary and install them
//! into every supported backend's global skills directory on launch.
//!
//! Backends are listed in [`SKILL_BACKENDS`] — adding support for a new CLI
//! (OpenRouter, OpenCode, etc.) is one line: append a new [`SkillBackend`].
//! Each backend declares the home subdir used to detect that it is installed
//! (`.claude`, `.codex`, …) and the path under the user's home where its
//! skills live.
//!
//! This is the *only* skill installer, over the single source tree
//! `crates/clud-bin/assets/skills/`. It used to share the job with a second
//! module (`skill_install.rs`) that embedded a parallel top-level `skills/`
//! tree; the two forked, wrote the same paths with different bytes, and fought
//! on every launch. See DD-039.
//!
//! We install only into a backend whose home subdir already exists — that way
//! users who only run one CLI don't get the other CLIs' skill directories
//! created in their home. A skill file the user has taken ownership of (the
//! `managed-by: clud` marker removed) is never overwritten, so user edits
//! survive; a clud-managed copy that has gone stale is refreshed in place.
//! Codex reads skills from `~/.codex/skills/`, mirroring
//! Claude's `~/.claude/skills/` layout. Clud-managed copies that an older
//! build wrote to `~/.agents/skills/` are purged best-effort during Codex
//! global setup.
//!
//! The asset files live under `crates/clud-bin/assets/skills/` and are
//! embedded at compile time via `include_str!`, so the runtime needs no
//! filesystem access to read the source content.
//!
//! Errors are non-fatal: `main()` calls [`ensure_installed`], logs any
//! failure to stderr, and proceeds with launch.
