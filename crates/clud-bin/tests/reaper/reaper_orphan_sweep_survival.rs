//! Tier 2 of #674, completing the lifecycle matrix: the **cross-platform**
//! reaper's three destructive entry points (#688).
//!
//! [`reaper_daemon_survival_windows`](./reaper_daemon_survival_windows.rs)
//! covers the Windows tool-shell reaper — the one whose blast radius is a
//! single `cmd.exe` subtree. This file covers [`clud::orphan_reaper`], which
//! runs on **every** foreground `clud` exit, on `clud slay`, and on the
//! daemon's periodic sweep, on every platform. Until #688 that reaper spared
//! by the cooperative `RUNNING_PROCESS_IS_DAEMON` marker alone, so an
//! sccache-shaped daemon survived the tool shell that started it (#681) and was
//! then killed moments later by clud's own exit.
//!
//! **Almost all reaper coverage belongs in Tier 1** — table-driven unit tests
//! over injected `ProcessFacts`, in `orphan_reaper`'s and `job_orphan_reaper`'s
//! test modules. Three tests live here, and only because what they exercise
//! cannot be faked: a **real** detached process that owns a **real** listening
//! socket, found through a **real** full-host environment scan.
//!
//! ## Why these sweeps cannot hurt the machine running them
//!
//! `clud slay` and the daemon sweep reap *every* CLUD-tagged orphan on the
//! host, which on a developer's workstation may include another session's
//! work. The tests therefore drive [`clud::orphan_reaper::reap_orphans_filtered`]
//! with an admission closure narrowed to this test's own stub PIDs. The
//! admission hook runs *before* `report_and_reap`, so the code under test —
//! scan, spare-list, classification, kill — is bit-for-bit what `clud slay`
//! executes; only the candidate set is narrowed.
//!
//! Raw `std::process::Command` is intentional and is why this file is in
//! `ci/banned_imports.py`'s exempt set: a `NativeProcess` would set the very
//! `RUNNING_PROCESS_IS_DAEMON` marker whose absence the sccache-shaped case is
//! about, and attach containment that masks the detach.
