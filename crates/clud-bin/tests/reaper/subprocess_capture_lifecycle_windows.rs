#![cfg(windows)]

//! Regression coverage for #634's post-spawn Job-assignment race.
//!
//! The fixture parent deliberately uses raw `std::process::Command`: it must
//! create a descendant immediately and without adding its own containment, or
//! the test would mask the exact gap it exists to exercise. The production
//! launch goes through `subprocess::ManagedSubprocess`.

use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

use clud::subprocess::ManagedSubprocess;

/// libtest matches `--exact` against the **module-qualified** test id.
///
/// #1056 consolidated the former top-level `tests/*.rs` files into modules of
/// one target, which changed every id from `<fn>` to `<module>::<fn>` (this
/// target's own `main.rs` says so). These fixtures re-invoke the test binary
/// and kept the pre-consolidation bare names, so `--exact` matched nothing,
/// the child ran zero tests, and the pid file it was supposed to write never
/// appeared -- surfacing 30s later as `NotFound` on the *parent* side, which
/// reads like a spawn or containment bug rather than a name that stopped
/// resolving.
///
/// Built from `module_path!()` rather than written out, so renaming this
/// module cannot leave a stale literal behind -- which is exactly how the
/// bare names survived #1056.
