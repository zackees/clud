#![cfg(windows)]

//! #333: the Windows runtime-cache hop must **relay**, not **contain**.
//!
//! Windows has no `execv`, so `runtime_cache::reexec_from_cached_binary` has
//! to spawn the cached `clud.exe` and wait for it. That wrapper is only
//! acceptable if it is otherwise invisible: whatever the relayed clud starts
//! must live exactly as long as it would have without the hop.
//!
//! The hop originally spawned through `NativeProcess`, which wraps every
//! Windows child in a `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` Job Object. Job membership is
//! inherited, so the relayed clud's *own* children joined that job too — and
//! `spawn_detached_self`'s `__daemon` does not request
//! `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB`. Closing the relay's job handle on exit
//! therefore killed the daemon it had just started, which is why
//! `CLUD_USE_RUNTIME_CACHE=1` failed 31 integration tests on Windows with a
//! `daemon.json` naming a dead PID.
//!
//! Only a real Job Object and a real detach can show this, so it is an
//! integration test rather than a unit one. It uses
//! [`daemon-stub`](../../../testbins/daemon-stub/src/main.rs)'s
//! `spawn-detached` mode, which reproduces exactly that shape: detach with
//! `DETACHED_PROCESS | CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`, no breakaway, no daemon
//! marker.
