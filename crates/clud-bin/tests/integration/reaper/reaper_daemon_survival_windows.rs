#![cfg(windows)]

//! Tier 2 of #674: long-lived daemons survive a clud session.
//!
//! **Almost all reaper coverage belongs in Tier 1** — table-driven unit tests
//! over synthetic process graphs and injected `ProcessFacts`, in
//! `job_orphan_reaper`'s `lifecycle_tests`. They run on every platform CI
//! builds for, need no spawning, and finish in microseconds.
//!
//! What is left here is only what cannot be faked: a **real** Job Object, a
//! **real** breakaway, and a **real** detached process that owns a **real**
//! listening socket. Four tests, deliberately. Anything expressible against
//! injected facts must not be added to this file.
//!
//! The stub is [`daemon-stub`](../../../testbins/daemon-stub/src/main.rs), not
//! a real sccache/docker/soldr install: depending on those being present would
//! make the suite non-hermetic, and the reaper keys on *signal shape*, which is
//! exactly what the stub reproduces.
//!
//! Raw `std::process::Command` is intentional and is why this file is in
//! `ci/banned_imports.py`'s exempt set: wrapping these fixtures in
//! `NativeProcess` would attach another Job Object and set the very daemon
//! marker whose absence the sccache-shaped case is about.
