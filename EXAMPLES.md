## CI/CD Integration

### Example 13: GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy to Production

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Install clud
        run: pip install clud[messaging]
      
      - name: Deploy with notifications
        env:
          ANTHROPIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          clud --notify-user "${{ secrets.TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID }}" \
            -m "Deploy ${{ github.sha }} to production"
```

---

### Example 14: GitLab CI with Multiple Channels

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - pip install clud[messaging]
    - |
      # Notify on Telegram
      clud --notify-user "$TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID" \
        -m "Deploy ${CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA} to production" &
      
      # Notify manager on SMS
      clud --notify-user "$MANAGER_PHONE" \
        -m "Production deployment in progress" &
      
      wait
  only:
    - main
```

---

### Example 15: Cron Job Monitoring

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /etc/cron.daily/backup

# Daily backup with notification on completion
clud --notify-user "+14155551234" \
  --cmd "/usr/local/bin/backup-databases.sh"
```

**Notification:**
```
‚úÖ Completed Successfully (3600s)

Backup completed:
- Database: myapp_production
- Size: 2.3 GB
- Location: s3://backups/2024-10-11/
```

---

## Advanced Patterns

### Example 16: Conditional Notifications

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Only notify if task takes longer than expected

# Start time
START=$(date +%s)

# Run task
clud --notify-user "@lead" -m "Optimize database queries"

# Calculate duration
END=$(date +%s)
DURATION=$((END - START))

# Send follow-up if took too long
if [ $DURATION -gt 600 ]; then
  # Use another clud command to send custom message
  echo "Task took ${DURATION}s - longer than expected!" | \
    clud --notify-user "@lead" -m "Performance note: query optimization"
fi
```

---

### Example 17: Multi-Step Workflow

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# multi-step-deploy.sh

set -e

# Step 1: Build
clud --notify-user "@devops" -m "Step 1/3: Build Docker image"

# Step 2: Test
clud --notify-user "@devops" -m "Step 2/3: Run integration tests"

# Step 3: Deploy
clud --notify-user "@devops" -m "Step 3/3: Deploy to production"

# Success notification
echo "‚úÖ All steps completed successfully!" | \
  clud --notify-user "@devops" -m "Deployment complete"
```

---

### Example 18: Error Recovery with Notifications

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# deploy-with-retry.sh

MAX_RETRIES=3
ATTEMPT=1

while [ $ATTEMPT -le $MAX_RETRIES ]; do
  echo "Attempt $ATTEMPT of $MAX_RETRIES"
  
  if clud --notify-user "@oncall" -m "Deploy to production (attempt $ATTEMPT)"; then
    echo "‚úÖ Deployment successful!"
    break
  else
    echo "‚ùå Deployment failed, retrying..."
    ATTEMPT=$((ATTEMPT + 1))
    sleep 60
  fi
done

if [ $ATTEMPT -gt $MAX_RETRIES ]; then
  # Final failure notification
  echo "‚ùå Deployment failed after $MAX_RETRIES attempts" | \
    clud --notify-user "@oncall" -m "URGENT: Manual intervention needed"
fi
```

---

## Testing Patterns

### Example 19: Test Suite with Conditional Notification

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# run-tests-notify.sh

# Run tests and capture exit code
if clud --notify-user "@qa-lead" --cmd "pytest tests/ -v"; then
  echo "‚úÖ All tests passed!"
else
  # Send urgent notification on failure
  echo "‚ùå TESTS FAILED - Please review immediately" | \
    clud --notify-user "@qa-lead" -m "Test suite failure alert"
  exit 1
fi
```

---

### Example 20: Performance Benchmarking

```bash
# Run performance benchmarks with progress tracking
clud --notify-user "@performance-team" \
  --notify-interval 45 \
  --cmd "python benchmarks/run_all.py --iterations=1000"
```

**Progress:**
```
‚è≥ Working (45s)
Benchmark 1/10: API latency - 45ms avg

‚è≥ Working (90s)
Benchmark 5/10: Database queries - 12ms avg

‚úÖ Completed (450s)
All benchmarks complete:
- API: 45ms (within SLA)
- DB: 12ms (improved 20%)
- Memory: 512MB peak
```

---

## Configuration Examples

### Example 21: Per-Project Configuration

```bash
# project-a/.env
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="bot_token_for_project_a"
export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="123456789"

# Usage in project
source .env
clud --notify-user "$TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID" -m "Build project A"
```

---

### Example 22: Multiple Bots for Different Teams

```bash
# Backend team notifications
export BACKEND_BOT_TOKEN="1234567890:ABC..."
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=$BACKEND_BOT_TOKEN clud --notify-user "@backend-dev" -m "task"

# Frontend team notifications
export FRONTEND_BOT_TOKEN="9876543210:XYZ..."
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=$FRONTEND_BOT_TOKEN clud --notify-user "@frontend-dev" -m "task"
```

---

### Example 23: Scheduled Notification Summary

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# weekly-summary.sh - Run via cron every Monday

# Generate and send weekly metrics
clud --notify-user "@team-lead" \
  --cmd "python scripts/generate_weekly_report.py"
```

**Crontab:**
```cron
0 9 * * 1 /home/user/scripts/weekly-summary.sh
```

---

## Tips & Tricks

### Quiet Mode (Completion Only)

```bash
# Set very high interval to only get start/end notifications
clud --notify-user "@dev" --notify-interval 999999 -m "quick task"
```

### Verbose Progress (Every 10 seconds)

```bash
# Get updates every 10 seconds for critical tasks
clud --notify-user "@oncall" --notify-interval 10 -m "critical fix"
```

### Multiple Contacts Pattern

```bash
# Create wrapper script for team notifications
#!/bin/bash
# notify-team.sh

TEAM_CONTACTS=(
  "@alice"
  "@bob"
  "telegram:987654321"
)

for contact in "${TEAM_CONTACTS[@]}"; do
  clud --notify-user "$contact" "$@" &
done

wait
```

**Usage:**
```bash
./notify-team.sh -m "Emergency maintenance in progress"
```

---

## Cost Optimization

### Use Telegram for Development

```bash
# Free notifications during development
clud --notify-user "@dev" -m "Dev task"
```

### Reserve SMS for Production Alerts

```bash
# Paid SMS only for critical production issues
if [ "$ENVIRONMENT" = "production" ]; then
  clud --notify-user "+14155551234" -m "Production deploy"
else
  clud --notify-user "@dev" -m "Staging deploy"
fi
```

---

## Troubleshooting Examples

### Test Telegram Bot

```bash
# Quick test to verify Telegram setup
echo "Test message" | clud --notify-user "123456789" -m "echo Hello World"
```

### Test SMS Delivery

```bash
# Verify Twilio configuration
clud --notify-user "+14155551234" --cmd "echo Testing SMS delivery"
```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run with verbose output to see notification details
clud -v --notify-user "@dev" -m "debug this task"
```

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use Telegram for dev environments** (free)
2. **Reserve SMS for production alerts** (cost-effective)
3. **Set appropriate notify-interval** (balance updates vs noise)
4. **Store credentials in environment variables** (security)
5. **Test notifications in staging first** (avoid surprises)
6. **Use descriptive task messages** (clear notifications)
7. **Monitor notification costs** (especially SMS/WhatsApp)
