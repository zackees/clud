**A Python CLI that runs Claude Code in "YOLO mode" by default, eliminating permission prompts for maximum development velocity**. In other words, it unlocks god mode for claude cli.

The name `clud` is simply a shorter, easier-to-type version of `claude`. Use `bg` mode to launch the sandboxed background agent with full Docker server capabilities.

## Why is clud better?

Claude Code's safety prompts, while well-intentioned, slow down experienced developers. `clud` removes these friction points by running Claude Code with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` in both foreground and background modes, delivering the uninterrupted coding experience Claude Code was meant to provide.

## Installation

```bash
pip install clud
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Unleash Claude Code instantly (YOLO mode enabled by default)
clud

# Launch background agent with full Docker server capabilities
clud bg

# Launch background agent with web UI for browser-based development
clud bg --open

# Execute specific commands in isolated container
clud bg --cmd "python test.py"
```

## Operation Modes

### Foreground Agent (Default)

Launches Claude Code directly with YOLO mode enabled - no permission prompts, maximum velocity:

```bash
clud [directory]                    # Unleash Claude Code in directory
clud -p "refactor this entire app"  # Execute with specific prompt
clud -m "add error handling"        # Send direct message
clud --continue                     # Continue previous conversation
```

**Features:**
- Claude Code with dangerous permissions enabled by default
- Zero interruption workflow - no safety prompts
- Direct prompt execution for rapid iteration
- Supports all standard Claude Code arguments

### Background Agent (`bg` mode)

Full Docker server mode with the same YOLO approach - perfect for complex development workflows:

```bash
clud bg [directory]               # Launch container shell (YOLO enabled)
clud bg --open                    # Launch VS Code server in browser
clud bg --cmd "pytest tests/"     # Run specific commands in container
clud bg --ssh-keys                # Mount SSH keys for git operations
clud bg --build-dockerfile PATH   # Build custom Docker image
```

**Features:**
- Interactive container shell with YOLO Claude Code built-in
- VS Code server (code-server) accessible via browser on port 8743
- Isolated `/workspace` directory synced from host `/host`
- SSH key mounting for seamless git operations
- Custom Docker image building and management
- Git worktree support for isolated branch development
- Container sync mechanism for workspace isolation
- **Telegram notifications** for agent launch and completion

### Telegram Notifications (New!)

Get notified when your agents launch and complete via Telegram:

```bash
# Quick setup (5 minutes)
clud bg --telegram \
  --telegram-bot-token "123456:ABC-DEF..." \
  --telegram-chat-id "123456789"

# Use environment variables (recommended)
export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="123456:ABC-DEF..."
export TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID="123456789"
clud bg --telegram
```

**What You Get:**
- ðŸš€ **Launch notification** - "Agent is online!"
- âœ… **Cleanup notification** - "Agent complete!" with summary
- ðŸ“Š **Duration tracking** - See how long tasks took
- ðŸ’¬ **Bidirectional** - Send messages to your agent
- ðŸ’° **FREE** - No API costs

**Setup:** Create bot via @BotFather, get chat ID from @userinfobot (5 minutes)

**Installation:**
```bash
pip install python-telegram-bot
```

See [TELEGRAM_SETUP.md](TELEGRAM_SETUP.md) for complete setup instructions.

### Advanced Modes

#### Fix Mode - Automated Linting & Testing
Automatically fix linting issues and run tests in a loop:

```bash
clud fix                          # Fix linting and run tests locally
clud fix https://github.com/...   # Fix issues from GitHub URL logs
```

Fix mode runs:
1. `codeup --lint --dry-run` up to 5 times, fixing issues each iteration
2. `codeup --test --dry-run` up to 5 times, fixing issues each iteration
3. Final lint pass to ensure code quality

#### Up Mode - Project Maintenance
Run the global `codeup` command with auto-fix capabilities:

```bash
clud up                           # Run codeup with auto-fix (up to 5 retries)
clud --codeup-publish            # Run codeup -p for publishing
```

### Task System

Clud includes a powerful task management system for structured development workflows:

```bash
clud --task task.md               # Open task file and execute autonomously
```

**Task Workflow:**
- Opens task file in editor for review/editing
- Executes task autonomously using research-plan-implement-test-fix-lint cycle
- Continues until completion, needs feedback, or reaches 50 iterations
- Provides final summary with status (SUCCESS, NEED FEEDBACK, or NOT DONE)

### Kanban Board

Launch an interactive kanban board for task management:

```bash
clud --kanban                     # Launch vibe-kanban board
```

## Configuration

### API Key Setup

```bash
# Interactive setup (recommended)
clud --login

# Use environment variable
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."

# Use command line
clud --api-key "sk-ant-..."
```

The API key is stored securely in `~/.clud/anthropic-api-key.key` for future use.

### Container Configuration

Configure container behavior with `.clud` file in your project root:

```json
{
  "dockerfile": "path/to/custom/Dockerfile"
}
```

## Background Mode Features

### Container Shell Options

```bash
# Basic options
clud bg --port 8080               # Custom port for code-server
clud bg --cmd "bash"              # Custom command to run
clud bg --shell zsh               # Use different shell

# Security options
clud bg --ssh-keys                # Mount SSH keys (read-only)
clud bg --read-only-home          # Mount home as read-only
clud bg --no-sudo                 # Disable sudo in container
clud bg --no-firewall             # Disable container firewall

# Development options
clud bg --claude-commands PATH    # Mount custom Claude CLI plugins
clud bg --env KEY=VALUE           # Pass environment variables
clud bg --detect-completion       # Enable idle detection (3s timeout)
clud bg --open                    # Open VS Code server in browser
```

### Git Worktree Support

Clud supports Git worktrees for isolated branch development inside containers:

```bash
# Worktrees are automatically available in /workspace
# Host repository is mounted at /host
```

The container sync mechanism (`sync` command inside container) handles bidirectional synchronization between `/host` and `/workspace`.

## Docker Image

The Docker image is available on Docker Hub as: **`niteris/clud`**

**Image includes:**
- Ubuntu 24.04 base
- Python 3.13
- Node.js 22 (via fnm)
- Claude CLI with YOLO mode alias

# Run specific test file
bash test tests/test_task.py
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run full linting suite
bash lint

# Run ruff check with auto-fix
uv run ruff check --fix src/ tests/

# Run ruff format
uv run ruff format src/ tests/

# Run type checking
uv run pyright
```

### Building Docker Image
